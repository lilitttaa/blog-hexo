**desc**: Game replays are becoming increasingly important for e-sports, learning, and social sharing, by driving player engagement outside the core game loop. Introducing a replay system into a existing game has many of its own unique challenges, as we discovered when bringing a server-side replay system to the already live console title, World of Tanks: Mercenaries. We will provide an overview of the infrastructure required to implement server-side gameplay recording and playback, including the architectural solutions to client-side problems when existing game engine assumptions about the flow of time and space are no longer true. Whilst the examples are specific to World of Tanks: Mercenaries, the concepts themselves are applicable to any game engine.

## From 'Assassin's Creed' to 'The Dark Eye': The Importance of Themes

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026747/From-Assassin-s-Creed-to
**desc**: Through an exploration of her work composing music for games such as Assassin's Creed Liberation, God of War, LittleBigPlanet and the upcoming RPG The Dark Eye: Book of Heroes, composer Winifred Phillips will examine the potential of thematic music to enable a game to stand out as special and unique. By employing musical themes, a composer can infuse a game with a strong sense of character and originality. According to research, music heard during activities is remembered vividly. Coupling this with the innately memorable nature of themes allows a game composer to create an indelible musical signature for any game. This talk will examine composition techniques that extend the life and utility of themes. Variation, development, figures, fragmentation, and motifs will be explored, along with examples of themes in combat, menus, cutscenes, and stingers. Finally, dynamic music construction will be considered, including workarounds to enable effective themes within interactive systems.

## Game Narrative Summit: Conflict, Mystery, and Connection in Casual, Free to Play Puzzle Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026704/Game-Narrative-Summit-Conflict-Mystery
**desc**: Most casual developers in our experience shy away from conflict under the wrongful assumption that anything that isn't light and happy will turn players off. But what we've seen is that player audiences can handle much more pathos than we give them credit for, and without the lows, you simply cannot appreciate the highs. You need both to tell a good story. Many players are drawn to games because they like to solve problems, and mystery provides a narrative problem to solve. This goes beyond the detective genre to include an element of mystery in any literary genre. Finally, connection is why players crave a populated world in their games. And they want the connections between characters, as well as between themselves and the characters, to be meaningful.

## Game Narrative Summit: Storytelling with Verbs: Integrating Gameplay and Narrative

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026610/Game-Narrative-Summit-Storytelling-with
**desc**: "Storytelling with Verbs" focuses on the ways in which we can reinforce gameplay with its inherent storytelling capabilities. Kaitlin Tremblay will discuss the inherent fiction behind our most common gameplay verbs, such as shooting, talking, deciphering (puzzle solving), hacking, etc., with specific examples from games in AAA, indie, mobile, ARGs, and escape rooms, and with a special eye toward how this becomes even more imperative in collaborative or competitive game spaces. This talk is intended to encourage greater collaboration between game design and narrative design in order to leverage the innate storytelling qualities in the fundamental building blocks of all of our games, to design together more playfully and more cohesively, and to create more compelling experiences, situations, and stories for players.

**desc**: We have some great models for storytelling, but often they're broken by the attempt to fit them into interactive experiences, or applied to cultures outside of Western norms. Starting with the dramatic question and the sequence method, the Forest Paths Method has been built on the principles of understanding the building blocks of drama to combine narrative and design elements into successful patterns tailored to the pillars of your game. These patterns can then be used by the whole team to start a new project, problem-solve current issues, or analyse past successes or failures. This session will follow an example of a fictional new game through the process, and by the end show a narrative design pattern that could service the start of development.

## Game VR/AR: 'Paper Beast': Technical Audio in a Simulated VR Ecosystem

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026707/Game-VR-AR-Paper-Beast
**desc**: In the world of indie game Paper Beast, everything is simulated. Creatures falling on a slippery obsidian slope, arachnids trying to uproot a plant with ropes, a small river suddenly flooding, wind waving curtains All elements are physics-driven and react to the player's touch and to one another. In this hyper-interactive context, audio has to mirror each situation accurately to have the game's world feel real and alive, especially considering the demanding nature of the VR support. nnPixel Reef's audio team shares how they crafted the detailed systems that breathe life into the game's procedurally animated creatures and dynamic landscapes, addressing physics-based audio, VR spatialization, audio-based animation, and more. They go through the various technical strategies and features they developed within their custom engine Atoll and Audiokinetic's Wwise, from the base audio creation from radio artist Floriane Pochon to the in-game result.

## Machine Learning Summit: Ragdoll Motion Matching

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026712/Machine-Learning-Summit-Ragdoll-Motion
**desc**: Physical human simulation holds the promise of unlocking unprecedented levels of interaction, fidelity, and variety to game animation. The incredibly intricate relations between a character's body and his environment can only be faithfully synthesized if we avoid cheating as much as possible, and trust the physics engine as the ground truth of what is possible in the virtual world. On the other hand, data-driven animation systems utilizing large amounts of motion capture data have shown that artistic style and variety can be preserved even when tight constraints on responsiveness are required by game design. We present an animation system that combines both ideas. A virtual robot is trained using deep reinforcement learning to closely follow the output of motion matching. The ragdoll is powered with his own motors, without 'god forces' attaching its limbs to points in global space, and learns to balance itself as it follows the interactive motion capture controlled by the user and recovers from unplanned perturbations. We believe that this result is an interesting milestone on the path towards realistic interactive virtual humans.

**desc**: We know Machine Learning is a powerful tool to tackle problems we can't solve by conventional means, but what about things we already have solutions for, such as physics simulations? Is there any reason to use Machine Learning in these cases? It turns out there is because in some cases Machine Learning allows us to trade-off computation time in exchange for additional memory usage, which can often be used to provide massive performance gains at runtime. In this talk I will show how we used Neural Networks and vast amounts of training data to construct extremely fast approximations of interactive physics and cloth simulations which achieved around 300 to 5000 times speedup over standard simulations, opening up new opportunities for what is possible within typical physics simulation budgets.

## Online Game Technology Summit: Machine Learning for Optimal Matchmaking

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026585/Online-Game-Technology-Summit-Machine
**desc**: Matchmaking has changed little since it was first automated. The general approach is to look for an ideal match across one or more preferred metrics, and then expand the ideal until a match is found. Issues with this approach make it difficult to trade-off the importance of each metric, hard to customize to specific player populations including geographic ones, and expanding forces players to wait longer than necessary. This session will present TrueMatch, a new matchmaking approach that allows developers to more intuitively express the value of each metric, and then uses machine learning to automatically optimize over the desired metrics in real-time. The results give better matches in less time and are customized to each player's characteristics and each region's real-time concurrency as it changes over time.

## Quad Mesh Simplification in Frostbite

**desc**: In early 2014, the Frostbite team started developing an in-house LOD technology for quad-based Bioware character models. Today that tech powers tools used by studios across Electronic Arts, from Battlefield to Plants vs Zombies. Quad-based models are widely used in the industry, and artists devote much care to their topology and edge flow. Yet simplification of quad meshes is less studied in the literature -- and popular LOD tools triangulate meshes and ignore topology. While LODs are sometimes thought of as throwaway, maintaining good topology benefits subsequent hand-editing, lighting and animation. For that reason, Bioware historically spent days per model hand-authoring their character LODs. Instead, this work aims to procedurally generate LODs that look like artist-authored models, most of the time, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per title. A lot was learned, and challenges were overcome. This talk will describe how they were solved.

What can be learned from these two approaches, and how can we as game designers ensure that all depictions, good and bad, are respectful to the LGBT+ community?

## RTXGI: Scalable Ray Traced Global Illumination in Real Time (Presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026722/RTXGI-Scalable-Ray-Traced-Global
**desc**: In this talk, we will discuss how you can achieve multi-bounce ray traced diffuse global illumination in real time with the new RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) SDK. RTXGI fits into the modern game engine by directly replacing existing indirect lighting approaches such as screen-space ray casting, precomputed lightmaps, and baked irradiance probes. We combine ray tracing, fast irradiance updates, and a moment-based depth scheme for occlusion calculations to create a scalable system without bake times or light leaks. RTXGI is supported on any DXR-enabled GPU and provides developers with an ideal starting point to bring the benefits of real-time ray tracing to their existing tools, knowledge, and capabilities.

## Stop & Think: Teaching Players About Media Manipulation in 'Headliner'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026724/Stop-Think-Teaching-Players-About
**desc**: Most games are designed to be fun and engaging, to keep the players playing. But at Unbound Creations, our goal is different. We want our players to stop, and reflect on their actions. This talk will use concrete examples from our award-winning games to show how we teach players about ethics through play, encourage critical thinking about media and fake-news, and make polarizing social/political issues humanely relatable.In "Headliner: NoviNews" you play as chief editor of the national news, deciding what articles get published every day. You watch as the world around you lives of several main characters gradually change. From the start, the game was designed to make players question their choices and become more critical of media. I will explain how we achieved that.Early in pre-development, we mined Google and Facebook data to find topics that are the most important and relatable to our target audience. We made issues relatable through personal struggles of in-game characters. We have also done the research to represent both sides of complex arguments fairly, based on actual rhetoric used in media. Our simple design principles led to complex series of trade-offs and moral dilemmas with no clear win or lose conditions. Lastly, we used gameplay mechanics to encourage (but not force) our players to organically engage in media-manipulation techniques, thus teaching players to recognize them in the real world.

## Stress-Free Game Development: Powering Up Your Studio With DevOps

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026630/Stress-Free-Game-Development-Powering
**desc**: Game development is hard. People crunch all the time, we launch games with tons of bugs, and it can even be nerve-wracking just to deploy updates! But does it really have to be like that? NO! In this talk, Seth Coster of Butterscotch Shenanigans walks through how his team learned to use DevOps to get more done while working less. In the past, they had trouble adding team members and maintaining their titles, and solved most problems through sheer force of will. But by employing the philosophies of DevOps, they were able to deploy weekly content patches in Early Access, expand their team, add nearly a dozen languages to their game, and line up six simultaneous launch platforms. By using the lessons outlined in this talk, you, too, can begin to transform your studio into a low-stress, high-output, clockwork machine!

You need to be able to sell why it makes sense as a business to do it. A Cost Benefit Analysis, CBA, is an analytical method of showing you why it makes sense to invest in that desired tech. This talks breaksdown and show you how to create a CBA for technology in our industry, weighing direct and intangible costs and benefits like an artist's time versus the quality of art. There will be a practical demo and template provided so you can compare the viability of all this tech around you. At the end of the day we are in a business, and that awesome tech is only as good as the benefits to costs ratio.

## Technical Artist Summit: Freeform Animation Rigging: Evolving the Animation Pipeline

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026754/Technical-Artist-Summit-Freeform-Animation
**desc**: Control rigs provide Animators efficient ways of authoring motion for animated skeletons. However, when the control rigs are animated in-game productions it becomes difficult to make changes to their structure and functionality while preserving animation.There is a new approach gaining popularity in the animation industry that circumvents these limitations called Freeform Animation. We will describe the theory behind how this works in general terms that could be applied to any platform for animation authoring using your own custom tools development.We will share how Unity has implemented Freeform Animation in the Animation Rigging package. These tools enable Animators to non-destructively preserve motion content while completely changing the structure of the control rig without the help of a rigging specialist. This helps to reduce counter-animation and alleviate the bottleneck of conventional control rigs. Animators are empowered to have a much faster iteration loop and greater degrees of control and customization.

**desc**: Developing an art tool can be a challenging task because it demands many detailed consideration and effort in the art of balancing between tool's functionality, stability and providing a good user experience for artists. Many times we heard stories about artists struggle with tech and new tech is not easily adopted by artists. What we need is a true marriage between artistic and technical so we can deliver an art tool that is welcomed by artists and empowered them.This session will first go through tool development core concepts that are specific to artists in the games industry, then dive deeper into more technical topics in constructing an artist-friendly view as well as implementing processes to ensure tool stability and extendibility. Examples will be shown in DCC and game engine to illustrate topics discussed here.

Second, we moved the responsibility for things like undo, copy/paste, save, revert, etc into a shared central data model so that tools get it "for free". Third, we standardized the way in which data interacts with views, so that the same views can be reused for different purposes. nnThis talk will discuss the consequences, pros and cons of our approach and show how it works in a concrete example: implementing an animation state machine editor.
