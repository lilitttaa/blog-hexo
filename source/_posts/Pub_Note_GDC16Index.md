## "Is that Me?" Identity Confusion & Narrative VR Challenges

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023750/-Is-that-Me-Identity
**desc**: Giz Gewirtz will explore the challenges of integrating the player experience into VR narratives, focusing specifically on the disassociation between character identity and the player's identity in virtual reality. He will outline the unique differences between VR storytelling and traditional game narratives, and provide practical tips and tricks on how to overcome those challenges. This talk will include real world examples of successes (and failures) in attempting to bridge the gap between traditional storytelling and experimental VR narratives.

## "It's Just Emulation!" - The Challenge of Selling Old Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023470/-It-s-Just-Emulation
**desc**: Turn on your video game-playing device of choice, right now, and you'll find limitless legal access to practically every song, film, and television show ever produced...yet, ironically, less than 1% of the actual video games. Keeping classic games in print is a surprisingly risky and difficult business. And while we can spend all day blaming technical hurdles, legal complications, and those darned software pirates for making these games so easy to download, the truth is that we've also done a pretty terrible job of maintaining our legacy. We've cheapened our games, to the point where anything older than a decade is assumed free. This isn't just a business concern, it's a creative one. If we can't keep our history alive, we risk forgetting our roots and losing a part of what made games great. But don't despair! If music can survive MP3s, games can survive this. Showcasing the approach taken for Capcom's Mega Man Legacy Collection, this talk will discuss how and why old games should and will become sellable again.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023468/-Life-is-Strange-Case
**desc**: Join the co-directors of the episodic game "Life Is Strange" as they reveal how they approached the inclusion of emotional, often sensitive, and sometimes taboo real-world issues into the core narrative of the game. Examples from the game will illustrate how the interactive nature of video games can be used to tackle difficult subject matters, driving players to reflect upon intense questions and emotional challenges; and how the coordinated development of story, characters and design can be used to achieve these goals.

**desc**: This collaborative post-mortem session explores the evolution of the live-operations strategy behind Hyper Hippo's hit 1M+ DAU game, AdVenture Capitalist. Initially, AdCap's opportunities for live-ops were limited because the game had launched with no back-end servers. After integrating PlayFab's powerful back-end operations platform, however, Hyper Hippo was able to boost monetization and retention by running live events, changing content on the fly, targeting player segments, and more. Learn how Hyper Hippo leveraged PlayFab services such as authentication, player profiles, content management, in-game commerce, messaging, advertising, and analytics, among others.

## 'DomiNations' Year One: History Games As Live Service

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023537/-DomiNations-Year-One-History
**desc**: DomiNations launched on mobile on April 1st, 2015 to great fanfare, high reviews, and strong word-of-mouth from players, eventually becoming the top 3rd-party launch of the year. It seemed the mobile market was excited for a historical strategy game in the vein of Age of Empires and Civilization. Four months later the title had sunk far below the top-100 grossing and the studio contemplated a tightly constrained future for the game. The team had failed to launch with key drivers of retention and revenue, and spent most of 2015 scrambling to add those features. Brick-by-brick, and with the help of a great Asia launch, they managed to reverse the game's decline and ensure the future stability of the studio.

## A Game That Listens - The Audio of INSIDE

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023731/A-Game-That-Listens-The
**desc**: Communication between a game and an audio engine is often a one-way street. The game passes information to the audio engine whereby audio is played back. With no information going the other way around, the game resembles a dancer unable to hear and respond to the sound playing. Being a temporal medium, sound often plays a key role in articulating temporal qualities such as pace, suspense and release. In order to retain continuity in such temporal experiences, and transition seamlessly from one temporal quality to another, the game needs to listen and adapt to the sound playing. Using Playdead's INSIDE as an example, various approaches to feedback loops between game and audio that have resulted in a refined temporal flow of the gameplay experience will be demonstrated. Examples include audio-driven gameplay, situations in which sound conducts in-game actions, and seamlessly incorporating death-respawn situations in the overall sound structure.

## A Stitch in Time: Metaplanning for AI with Unusual Time Controls

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023417/A-Stitch-in-Time-Metaplanning
**desc**: Most games and therefore, game AI are developed with certain assumptions of how the world works. One assumption that is fairly universal is that time moves forward and what is done cannot be undone. But what if that assumption is violated? How do you write an AI when the player can freely edit the timeline of actions? In this lecture, Marq Singer and Dr. Chris Hazard talk in detail about creating the AI for their upcoming game, Plosh: Time Bomb. The game turns fast-paced crate-and-bomb game mechanics into a strategic, turn-based game where the players (including the AI players) are allowed to make changes to their strategies at any point in time during their turn. They will share algorithms and heuristics for how they approached this problem, including how the AI determines when in a plan to make modifications, They will also introduce metaplanning techniques and their "metaminmax" algorithm.

Among them, are arbitrary material layering, decoupling shading rate from rasterization, and shader anti-aliasing. Object space lighting is a technique inspired by film rendering techniques like REYES. By reversing the process and shading as early as possible and not in rasterization space, we can achieve arbitrary material layering, shader anti-aliasing, decoupled shading rates, and many more effects, all in real-time.

This talk will present a method for adaptively scaling fidelity to consistently maintain VR framerate without using reprojection techniques, even on very low-end GPUs, while also having the ability to increase fidelity for high-end GPUs and multi-GPU installations. Valve's Aperture Robot Repair VR experience that was shown at GDC 2015 required an NVIDIA 980 to maintain framerate, but this talk will use that same experience as an example of how we now adaptively scale fidelity to maintain 90 fps on an NVIDIA 680, a 4-year-old GPU. The end result is an engine that appears higher fidelity throughout the experience, a lower GPU min spec, increased art asset limits, and a system that allows developers to stop focusing on framerate and instead spend their time increasing the quality and performance of their renderer while consistently maintaining framerate.

In this talk, the sole animator and over-tasked generalist for The Flame in The Flood will discuss how to rapidly generate AAA-quality quadruped locomotion. This is a video-heavy talk that focuses on animation authoring and state blending for quadruped characters. These characters have unique foot sliding challenges and traditional solutions result in either poor fidelity motion or a bloated animator workload. Our speaker will illustrate techniques for effortlessly creating high quality quadruped locomotion without the need for transition animations. During the talk two different quadruped characters will be examined - a boar with a rigid spine, and a large, gangling wolf with a procedural spine. Each character delivers a unique and seamless performance without the use of any transition animations between gaits.

Techniques covered will include strategies for converting mathematical expressions into animations through a shader node editor and how to leverage vertex color maps to refine shader animation. We will also discuss ways in which game engine parameters can be leveraged in shader functions as well as how vertex animation can complement keyframed skeletal animation to give the appearance of more detailed complexity while still remaining efficient at runtime.

## Animation Bootcamp: 'Rainworld' Animation Process

**desc**: Game animation has come into its own in recent years, forcing animators to wield a unique blend of art, design and technical prowess. The animation bootcamp is at the forefront of sharing that knowledge with developers everywhere. Bringing together a group of experienced and specialized animation experts, across AAA and Indie, this bootcamp is a daylong gathering to rally developers from all over the industry, with a focus on deeper discussions into the needs of strong character performances and player communication. The day starts with more "traditional" focused talks on expected animation process but then throughout the day the focus will quickly transition into how to best apply that knowledge to game development. Through different tools and disciplines, the talks will show how the unique constraints and demands of games are creating the need for a new breed of animator.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023498/Audio-Bootcamp-Why-I-Rejected
**desc**: The GDC Audio Boot Camp returns for its 15th year, bringing a range of industry veteran subject matter experts to discuss their own experiences and skills in technical, creative, and business topics related to sound for games. Topics this year include audio best practices for casual games, implementation/integration, music composition, sound design, making and sustaining a career, and more. And the ever-popular lunchtime surgeries offer a unique opportunity to sit and meet with many of the speakers in a smaller-scale setting to talk about the specific interactive audio topics that are at the front of attendees' minds. The intended audience is composers, sound designers, audio programmers, designers, producers, and all who want a leg up on how the highly realistic and immersive soundscapes of present day games are created across the spectrum of platforms.

**desc**: The vast majority of all digital games rely heavily on their graphics to convey information and bring enjoyment. For the visually impaired community there are very few games to play, and even fewer that sighted gamers also play. How can you create a mobile game that is equally enjoyable regardless of whether you look at the graphics or use audio only? This talk will be about the benefits of audio-driven game design, tips on how you can include visually impaired players in your game and the importance of being able to share the gaming experience with others. We will share tips and tricks and discuss why bringing audio into the design process early can enrich the gaming experience without hindering the rest of the game development process.

## Co-Development: Open and Agile Game Development

**desc**: Traditional game development consists of the developer working behind closed doors on their vision. Periodically, and in very controlled circumstances, the customers can see the work in progress but that is mostly elaborate trailers, often not even showing actual game play. Most importantly the customers cannot give feedback while the game is still being developed. Co-development by being open and agile completely changes that paradigm. Customers see the game at all stages and begin playing it as soon as it is possible, providing feedback that can change the game for the better. This method requires full transparency and a very regular cadence of content delivery.

Within the framework of Unity, we highlight our move to physically-based shading, the use of static image-based lighting and solutions to devices lacking OpenGLES 2.0 and the texCubeLOD instruction. We finish with our approach to car paint simulation, an HDR-like adaptation and some hybrid methods we used to create the illusion of dynamic specular reflections while maintaining glossy surfaces.

## Depression-Proof Studio Culture: A How-To For Mental Wellness

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023459/Depression-Proof-Studio-Culture-A
**desc**: One in four adults in America experience some mental health issue due to factors such as long hours, workplace isolation, and transitory employment. Due to the nature of highly technical and creative work, that figure is higher in the games industry. Possibly as high as 50%. Mental health issues accelerate burnout and drain productivity. Depression alone accounts for over 200 lost workdays a year, at a cost of billions of dollars in productivity. Game studio culture can accelerate or exacerbate symptoms of mental illness, and many emotional ailments can worsen in the game industry workplace, resulting in tragic outcomes. This 1-hour lecture will offer simple, effective advice on how too de-stigmatize mental health issues in your studio; help yourself and others create a positive work experience; effectively reach to those who may be suffering silently; and create a culture with a positive resistance to mental health issues.

## Designing a VR renderer and engine for modern CPU/GPUs using MaxPlay's Game Development Suite (GDS) (presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023526/Designing-a-VR-renderer-and
**desc**: VR is pushing existing engines beyond their original design. Designing a realtime renderer and game engine for modern hardware and VR is an enormous undertaking. At MaxPlay we've gathered the requirements, resulting in a need to support VR, scalability to a variety of multi-processor platforms, multiple 3D apis (DX11/DX12/VulKan) and multiple GPU configurations.. It's all about getting the data to the GPU as fast as possible to fully leverage the GPU. This has resulted in a MaxPlay designed engine that leverages multi-processor systems with scalable performance based on the number of available cores, and a rendering architecture that matches the simulation design while also targeting VR. In this talk, we will discuss how MaxPlay's engine architecture addresses VR performance pain points.

Killer ARPU, great retention, a rabid community of evangelists, a great looking product and a multi-million dollar warchest from the recent financing had many industry pundits predicting that Space Ape's second game was guaranteed to be a Top 20 Grossing hit. When the dust settled on launch the critically acclaimed game emerged around Top 100 grossing - Top 50 on a good event day - which is a great success by any measure for an independent developer and something to be proud of, but did not exhibit the level of commercial success many in the industry were expecting. In this session, Space Ape founder and COO, Simon Hade, will share the research that led to some critical decisions he believes ultimately held the game back from fulfilling it's potential but also the lessons learned, especially around theme testing and positioning, as well as the key product and community tactics which have allowed the company to grow the game month on month with almost no marketing spend. In the process, he will provide an overview of the current landscape of the broader mid-core genre, game and marketing metrics and tactics that are important to launch a game in today's market.

## Dynamic Stories for Dynamic Games: Six Ways to Give Each Player a Unique Narrative

Shouldn't our stories be just as dynamic as the rest of our games? This talk explores the strengths of games with dynamic stories, looking at six specific techniques that have been used in games from the very popular to the more obscure. The talk explores how these techniques can be combined in new and interesting ways, helping narrative designers and writers identify and strengthen the dynamic elements in their stories, keeping players engaged with the narrative for as long as they play the game. Just as each player gets a gameplay experience unique to them, so too can they get a narrative that becomes their own.

## Effective Testing for Free-to-Play Games

**desc**: Mobile games have become increasingly high-stakes over the last few years. Successful games make billions, but most games launch to failure, and few get a second chance from either platforms or players. Most developers test their games in various ways, from individual playtest sessions to geo-locked launches in Canada and Australia. But many games still launch with poor retention, monetization, tech problems, or some combination of the three. What's going wrong? Kongregate has now put more than 20 games through test markets, learning valuable lessons along the way. This talk will be a pragmatic guide to creating a test strategy, taking into account budget and schedule along with the benefits and pitfalls of various methods and the psychological traps that teams fall into as they evaluate results. The talk will be illustrated by case studies and metrics from Kongregate's portfolio including AdVenture Capitalist, Global Assault, Spellstone, Raid Brigade and more.

How do you produce thousands of levels without repeating yourself or sacrificing quality?

This is a sequel to GDC 2012's highly rated "Inspiration from the Trash", and the final nail.Finding these games is beyond the reach of most (they're not on YouTube). Rather than navigate the idiosyncrasies of TRS-80 emulation software, research which games are worth remembering, and master the unforgiving gameplay, people can instead attend this presentation. In-between games, we'll reflect on how modern issues were viewed 35 years ago. Cloning, sequels, casual games, licensed games, apocalypses all existed, and distance will provide attendees with insight into their future.

Knowing which of your proposed game design features fit with what part of your player's motivational journey is what this talk is all about. As a bonus, this unholy semi-unified motivation model also works as a fantastic tool to communicate your project's answer to the timeless questions: "Who are our players?

## Everyone's Silent Enemy: Shame and Vulnerability

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023310/Everyone-s-Silent-Enemy-Shame
**desc**: The games industry continues to make strides towards speaking openly and outwardly about diversity and discrimination. However true that might be, battling with the inner dialogue and introspection is rarely, if ever, talked about. Depending on how that very dialogue concludes, it can be very difficult to create and tell your stories; It can even result in complete silence. How do we take our tendency towards silence and turn it into a story that can reach and touch others feeling alone? Renee Nejo talks about bridging the severed gap of human connection that our shame creates, specifcially centered around a Native American Narrative and the game Blood Quantum.

**desc**: Statistics tell us that most players don't finish our games, let alone replay them. For RPGs, however, choice, consequence and replayability are viewed as crucial aspects of the genre. How do we provide players with a satisfying experience without tripling or quadrupling our workload? This talk will outline, compare and contrast three common branching structures, exploring the positives and negatives from both story and production perspectives. Finally, it will explore why the repeating diamond narrative or parallel paths structure is most successful in providing a satisfying branching experience, without the headache of a traditional branching narrative.

## Fitting the World: A Biomechanical Approach to Foot IK

But this is often associated with either sluggish responses to very snappy/jerking motion on the knees and distinctly procedural motion. In an effort to improve the animation quality in the complex and organic environments within Assassin's Creed they sought out to improve the IK system by moving away from reactive solving, and by adapting a predictive solution modelled after biomechanical behaviour that allowed them to better preserve detailed motion from the animation, creating a more natural, fluid and accurate foot IK system.

## Forging The River in "The Flame in The Flood"

**desc**: This presentation will cover the many techniques that went into creating the procedurally-generated river of the "Flame in the Flood", the survival "roguelite" from The Molasses Flood. In the game, the player undertakes a perilous journey down a swollen river through a post-societal American South. Most of the game takes place on a rickety raft, with the player navigating around obstacles and through treacherous rapids, stopping occasionally to scrounge for food and supplies. The River thus forms the essential backbone of the entire player experience. This talk will cover the major representations and algorithms used to generate the river, including a simulated-annealing-like optimization algorithm for island and river edge placement, a "cartoon hydrodynamics" scheme for generating and rendering water flow, and their approach to probabilistic resource scheduling. Throughout, the tight relationship between these various procedural generation processes and specific gameplay design goals across multiple timescales of play will be emphasized.

## Game Design and Mind Control in SUPERHOT

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023483/Game-Design-and-Mind-Control
**desc**: SUPERHOT is an experimental FPS with the core idea of "time moves only when you move". We allowed this basic principle to resonate through the entire game design, with a view to crafting a unique gameplay experience. Dodging bullets, grabbing weapons mid-air, using random items as improvised weapons are some of the things that resulted. Thus, the game features intense combat on a much tighter scale than the typical FPS.

And, not for the sake of making money, but for the sake of promoting new game ideas and creativity, exercising the pure art of games creation. Sure, people have to make money to survive and flourish as games companies, but it's just as important that those artistic tastemakers are able to flourish without the pressure of monetization.

Many games are addressing serious social issues even more seriously than serious games, generating new and strange experiences. And many games made for social change or learning are simply doing it wrong.We're entering the "third wave" of games for change and it's time to get with the movement! Even if you don't consider yourself a games for change-ist, this talk will shed light on your own practice, and how what you do, whether you are aware of it or not, is implicitly tied to this shift in games for change.

This lecture will explain how they took this opportunity to address and improve the AI system and the challenges they faced in the process. The talk will cover the systems underlying the party AI system and how they leveraged the modular approach for constructing creature AI. Additionally, Sebastian will discuss issues surrounding working in a larger, more open, more ambient environment than existed in prior games.

## Gods and Dumps: Attribute Tuning in 'Pillars of Eternity'

**desc**: Pillars of Eternity was a crowfunded game inspired by A/D&D classics like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment. To stay true to backers' expectations, one of their early constraints was a classic six attribute spread - a constraint that doesn't always play well with different classes and character concepts. In the classic games, it was easy to build a non-viable character - even if the player didn't realize it until they were 10 hours deep. Conversely, in Pillars of Eternity, the team often deviated too far from convention for player tastes. This talk will explore the specific RPG mechanic as it was in the classic games, as they developed it through the Pillars of Eternity beta, and how they continued to use player feedback to tune it post-launch. The talk will also take a look back across the project as a whole to see how the design of attributes influenced other game systems and the player experience in the long run.

Some work has been done, of course, on multi-agent, squad-based AI as well. But what do you do when you are dealing with the siege of a castle that may pit hundreds of attackers against hundreds of defenders? A proper siege is a complex machine of roles, responsibilities, and reactions on a large scale.

## High-performance, Low-Overhead Rendering with OpenGL and Vulkan (presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023516/High-performance-Low-Overhead-Rendering
**desc**: As advanced games and applications continue to push the performance envelope, developers look to their 3D APIs for improved predictability, threading and reduced CPU load. New extensions to OpenGL and a totally new 3D API Vulkan are answering these requests directly. This session introduces and details both of these approaches. The session shows how applications can use OpenGL "AZDO" (Approaching Zero Driver Overhead) extensions like NVIDIA's Command Lists to greatly reduce single-threaded CPU overhead while reusing existing OpenGL code. Going further, the second section introduces the new 3D API from Khronos called Vulkan; focusing on how to use Vulkan's command buffers, precompiled "SPIR-V" shaders, application-managed rendering resources and rendering queues, to take full advantage of true multi-threaded rendering. The speakers detail how to efficiently synchronize multiple threads using Vulkan at top performance. Finally, there is a discussion of the tradeoffs of extended OpenGL and AZDO versus Vulkan, and how a developer might choose between them. Throughout, examples of real applications and source code are shown.

The unit is the "user-customizable game" (think CCGs but beyond just trading cards) which is part of both our undergrad and graduate curriculum at the NYU Game Center. It's a unit that engages with ideas of player expression and creativity, procedural representation of game content, community formation around games, visual communication, and balancing complex systems.The session will unpack the in-class activities, readings, core topics, and project assignments of the entire month-long unit. This section of the class includes no less than four complete in-class game exercises that take the form of games to be modified by students. None of these exercises have yet been shared outside of NYU and at the session all four of these tabletop games that teach game design will be detailed.Please come with your questions and comments about how you teach game design in the classroom so that we can all share our methods and ideas to improve the ways that we teach and learn.

**desc**: User Experience practices and User Research are a crucial part of the game development process, but there are still numerous hurdles to overcome in order to make UX insights useful and actionable to the dev team. It's possible for a UX team to underestimate development challenges, and a dev team might misunderstand the UX team's intent. Consequently, UX may fail, either because the UX team can't deliver what the game devs are looking for, or because the devs don't use the UX tools correctly. In order to get the best return on investment stop thinking of UX as a verb. By fostering collaboration between the UX team and development team, you can build UX practices into the pipeline. Hear from a UX and a Production representatives on how this process was implemented and iterated on at Epic Games.

This tech can be applied to video games or to feature films; for main characters or for crowd simulations; for offline or for runtime implementation.While the tech borrows from retargeting, the core principles differ and allow for application at runtime. This introduces realtime reaction to change in environment (obstacles), props (weight and style of operation) and character stats (tired, wounded, etc).

Find out how a subtler understanding of morality can inform the writing behind so-called "strong female characters" that answers some of the critiques made of the gaming industry while also creating worthwhile content that enhances the narrative goals of your game. A look at some of the more successful examples of morally-grey, "immoral" women in videogame history followed by an analysis of what the writers got right (and wrong in a few cases) shows that we have the technology to tell women's stories in a fascinating way that doesn't sell us short as people, capable of good and evil (and, occasionally, something in-between).

We will give a general overview of the Dawn Engine�?and show how Umbra was integrated from the edition and offline building to the low level rendering engine to achieve this goal. We will go into the details of how Umbra was used for the main camera, but also the generation of the shadow maps. Since many of our lights are static, we cached the static geometry visibility to speedup the umbra query. We will also discuss how we used umbra to speed up our offline GI computation.

Especially for individuals with little experience and those seeking to break in, this session encourages participants to ask veteran writers and narrative designers questions that don't have definitive answers in manuals or on the web. Anyone working with writers is also encouraged to attend. Whether it's finding the right job, leading writers and improving team dynamics, or establishing rates, no question about the business of game writing is off limits.

A game's world is a set and the player is the lead actor--as amazing as starring in a one-person show might be, a world that surrounds the player with life can be far more immediate and engrossing. Environmental storytelling does a great job of hinting at lives past, but AI actors with systemic behaviors are the key to demonstrating the life of a level right in front of the player. The presence that these performers and their interactions lend to the experience help the player to believe in the world itself. The talk will look at the systems driving Elizabeth, BioShock Infinite's companion character, and the "living world" of Mafia III, relating lessons learned during development and giving guidelines for bringing a level and its occupants to life.

It will explore some basic urban design principles and look at how architecture emphasizes mood as its main experience, and how it uses atmosphere rather than symbolism. For instance, rather than communicate a regal space through crowns and thrones, it uses geometry, material, texture, colour, lighting, construction, and so on to create a grand and formal space that sets the necessary tone for the audience before they encounter more direct methods of storytelling.

**desc**: This talk will focus on the challenges and lessons learned in designing levels for Manifold Garden, which revolves around 3D world wrapping and other types of impossible geometry. The talk will introduce different types of world geometry and help the audience to "visualize" them. William will go over how he has changed level design techniques in order to adapt to new geometries. Some established techniques that work well in flat geometry do not carry over to other geometries. For example, object height in a 3-torus no longer makes sense as reference points or gating mechanisms. There are, however, certain level design concepts and techniques which are more universal: avoiding vast areas of flatness, and the use of subtle repeated architectural elements to guide the player. Throughout the talk, I will be showing the evolution of the game, and how the level design evolved alongside the core mechanics. The talk will also cover the importance of "intention" in architecture. When working with unusual geometry, every element has to have a purpose and be able to communicate it to the player effectively.

Health in games is often reduced to a simple binary of 'alive' or 'dead' with very little between, but there is so much more to human vitality than that.

**desc**: In this talk, Tyriq Plummer explores both the resilience and fragility of the human body, examining how our physical shortcomings can be applied to games in order to create more interesting situations. Health in games is often reduced to a simple binary of 'alive' or 'dead' with very little between, but there is so much more to human vitality than that. Tyriq looks at games that have tried more unique ways of representing the continuum of life, as well as real-life instances of humans surviving in extreme circumstances to see what can be learned and applied to games.

## Magical Realism: The Art of Creating Everest in Your Living Room with VR (presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023531/Magical-Realism-The-Art-of
**desc**: In EVEREST VR we wanted to recreate the feeling of summiting EVEREST as faithfully as possible in VR. Photorealism was a key element to achieve full immersion which could only be done by pushing the limits of models, textures and shaders while still trying to work within the constraints of vanilla UE4 and the punishing performance requirements of VR. Another aspect involves subtler 'brain hacks' and manipulation of perceptive realism in order to fully engage with the lizard brain of the user. The combination of the two creates a stronger and more subjective sense of realism, a kind of magical realism, that we think is especially well adapted to VR.

## Making "Big Data" Work for 'Halo': A Case Study

**desc**: In 2012, 343 decided to embark on creating a completely new telemetry infrastructure, overhauling its data gathering capabilities. The studio went from end-of-game snapshot data to a hybrid model which adds real-time telemetry transmission that feeds into streaming analytics in the cloud. This is their story: of the challenges that were faced, and the treasures that were won. We all want to make our games better, and gathering information is naturally the first step to understanding player's experiences. With the advent of "Big Data," we face a daunting challenge in identifying the most useful information in a sea of facts, as well as gathering large volumes of data without impacting the game itself. Tom Mathews would like to share with you how they approached this problem space, and provide a few pointers for those that follow in their footsteps. See you there!

## Math for Game Programmers: Balancing TCGs With Algebra, Not Magic

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023564/Math-for-Game-Programmers-Balancing
**desc**: The foundation of any digital or physical card game necessarily lies in its balance, such that most cards are useful without any being dominant. While balance can be left to (error-prone) designer intuition or suggested post-release by analytics the ability to balance cards algebraically can dramatically reduce guesswork and playtest times for new cards and sets. Attendees will learn techniques for deriving cost/benefit curves for existing games, thereby objectively identifying unbalanced gameplay elements and aiding in the design of new ones. These methods easily extend to other genres in which costs are balanced against utility.

In this session, we show how to construct natural-feeling jump trajectories from designer-friendly input like desired height and distance, modeled programmatically using one of a few available integration methods. We extend these principles to facilitate irregular or non-parabolic jumps, such as varying jump height based on player input or falling rapidly beyond the peak of a jump.

Such parameterizations are chosen in order to have a simple and straightforward description of the admissible range of rotation. Quaternion space parameterization is notoriously unintuitive and often perceived as unfit for describing ranges of rotation. This talk will compare different techniques for enforcing rotational joint limits and discuss their merits for use in real-time IK and physics solvers. The audience will learn how to apply these techniques directly in quaternion space, thus avoiding the use of expensive trig functions required for conversions.

The perception of your AI will not mainly be shaped by its usual behavior, but by the times it deviates from the norm. Second, we will challenge the idea that "ally AI should support the player." Instead we explain why ally AI should first and foremost serve the game. Finally, we show why you should not fear repetition in your AI behaviors.

## Mobile Devices and Disabled Gamers

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023360/Mobile-Devices-and-Disabled
**desc**: 20% of gamers have some kind of disability, and many mobile gamers also encounter situational impairments, such as playing in direct sunlight, or holding onto a handrail on the underground. Small screens and touch interfaces bring some accessibility barriers and solutions that are specific to mobile devices. This session will share insights on what accessibility and disability actually mean and why they are important. It will also share some easy mobile-specific considerations you can make in your own games, and the human and business impact that they can bring.

## Mobile Is The New Core Gaming

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023365/Mobile-Is-The-New-Core
**desc**: Mobile is the biggest platform by numbers, but many developers still consider it "casual". But is that thinking out of touch? Is it fair to claim that mobile is not "core" especially when it hosts titles like Vainglory? Is the industry failing to notice a deep shift in the way that people play? Is it time that we start thinking of mobile as the new "core"? Featuring Lulu LaMer (Funomena), Daniel Cook (SpryFox), Emily Greer (Kongregate), Lee Perry (Bitmonster), Ramine Darahiba (Storm8) and Tadhg Kelly (design consultant) these are the questions that this panel will discuss.

## Motion Matching and The Road to Next-Gen Animation

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023280/Motion-Matching-and-The-Road
**desc**: This presentation introduces Motion Matching, an innovative new approach for creating high quality, fluid and complex character movement. The team adopted a declarative animation philosophy, where instead of placing small animations in a big structure, they place small structured markup on top of long animations. This manual markup is necessary for logical information that can't be inferred automatically, like attack types and defense stances. For navigation, they don't have to manually organize transition animations like starts, stops, and turns. They just capture 5 or 10 minutes of a person running around and import it directly into the engine. At runtime, they continuously find the frame in the mocap database that simultaneously matches the current pose and the desired future plan, and transition with a small blend time to this other place in the data. The resulting motion is almost indistinguishable from a raw mocap sequence, while being responsive enough for comfortable control.

## On All Fours: Creating Realistic Quadruped Motion

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023433/On-All-Fours-Creating-Realistic
**desc**: Simple pathfinding and pathfollowing has long been a well-understood problem; however, as soon as we step outside our normal comfort zone of bipedal locomotion, many of the shortcuts and much conventional wisdom that has been created and relied on are no longer valid. The most fundamental limitation that is almost universally imposed on a character's locomotion is to assume that a bounding circle describes the character's footprint in the pathfinding world. While this works well for humans and other bipedal upright creatures, it does not work for a quadruped character (e.g. a horse or dog) with an oblong footprint required to navigate an obstacle-rich environment with passages narrower than the character's length, but wider than its shoulder width. This lecture will explain a solution to this problem that does not require the use of more advanced motion planning algorithms or solving hard problems like "the piano mover's problem".

Sunless Sea, our third crowdfunded project, was not a runaway success - but it was a solid, critically acclaimed first-time success. We used open publishing techniques to bootstrap from being a moribund studio months from bankruptcy to a successful, cash-flow positive company with our first Unity game. We want to pay it forward by sharing what we learned - war stories, anecdata, and specific, quantified advice on the benefits and problems of these practices.

## Precognitive Interactive Music: Yes You Can!

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023313/Precognitive-Interactive-Music-Yes-You
**desc**: Feature film, television, and linear visual media use music to create powerful emotions and narrative propulsion through the feeling of anticipation. Up until now, game music has been reactive after the fact to unpredictable player input. What if your game could use music to dynamically create that ramp of anticipation, whether your player is leaping from a collapsing building, speeding toward a finish line, or about to take down a boss? Paul Lipson and Robert Ridihalgh of Microsoft Studios discuss how audio pipelines can add foresight and precognition into dynamic runtime game experiences to unlock emotional power before events happen, to go beyond the expected.

While these mechanics of game production are indeed important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: the emotional and nebulous portion of being a producer. In order to maintain the health of a project, producers must react to team dynamics, and adjust things on the fly. Once processes are in place, the producer must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022935/Rules-of-the-Game-Five
**desc**: There's no absolute "rule book" for the art of game design, yet every designer has a personal set of techniques they call their own. The popular "Rules of the Game" session returns to present five highly accomplished designers who each share a key rule-of-thumb that they employ when designing a game. Each speaker gets ten minutes to present a rule and go into detail about how they've used it on some of their most successful projects. These are unique and personal techniques that are not commonly held design wisdom and may well challenge the way you think about design. Speakers talk honestly about the pluses and minuses of each technique, helping the audience understand where the rules apply and where they may not. Come to hear novel and useful game design concepts while also learning how some very interesting designers go about making great games.

## Running a Women's eSports Tournament

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023580/Running-a-Women-s-eSports
**desc**: Framed by the goal of growing the participation of women in esports, we believe that all-women's tournaments are a worthwhile strategy for creating more opportunities for players, providing visibility for role models, and building welcoming community spaces. In this talk, professional CSGO player - Stephanie "missharvey" Harvey of CLG Red - and tournament organizer - Morgan Romine of ESL and Any Key - team up to discuss how women's tournaments could be run. Using a recent case-study of the Intel Challenge at IEM Katowice 2016, a women's CSGO tournament, we will examine the real, lived-in experiences of women pro-players, as well as the logistics of running an all women's esports tournament. We will address some of the most common challenges that women players face, and the things that can support them best. We will also talk about the important ways in which pro-level women's tournaments are identical to, and different from, any other professional esports event.

## Running Live: Many Games for a Long Time

**desc**: Games are becoming more of a service than a product. As a service, games have to constantly offer new content before users move on or quit. A couple of years after going to live service, the game software suffers software bloat and the entire game team gets into technical debt rapidly.This talk will share experiences dealing with the technical debt in many live projects, mostly about extreme cases and experiences in Dungeon & Fighter, one of the most successful and largest online PC game in Asia.As live service gets older and bigger, it gets harder to notice critical problems that are occurring to small number of users (like crashes, lags, memory problems and hacking) and even if these issues are identified, it is still hard to know the scope of the problem and can be costly to debug and reproduce.This talk will also give a sneak peek into how Nexon is developing technology to deal with such problems for many projects in effective, efficient and reusable way such as finding the cause without having to reproducing it in development environment or having to add debugging log.

## Sculpting a Gameplay Scripting Solution

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023204/Sculpting-a-Gameplay-Scripting
**desc**: It has been observed - albeit somewhat jokingly - that the spreadsheet is the universal language of game design. But what is it that makes spreadsheets so approachable and yet immensely powerful? What if those same principles could be harnessed to make gameplay scripting and game logic implementation just as approachable, with no compromises in power? This session will cover a comprehensive model for implementing gameplay logic that can be layered atop any existing scripting solution - or even implemented easily as its own miniature language of sorts. The model takes the best elements of spreadsheets - simple building blocks and infinite composability - and combines them with an elegant architecture for controlling game entities over time. The result is directly accessible to any game designer, while powerful enough to implement even sophisticated game mechanics with a minimum of old-fashioned code.

The roar of highly tuned engines screaming past, the reflections from surrounding structures, and the echoing in the distance all make up the aural chaos that is race day. But how do you simulate all of that to the player and still allow them to hear crucial audio feedback like tire noise that will either send them to the front of the pack or send them careening into a stack of tires? In this talk, Turn 10 Studios' Creative Audio Director, Nick Wiswell, and Audio Lead, Chase Combs, will discuss how the team approached the mix of the game, attempting to balance a dense sonic landscape with detailed audio feedback for players.

Gordy Haab, composer, and David Jegutidse, sound designer, were part of the DICE audio team that were fortunate enough to work with and build upon this legacy, as they worked to create the music and sound for the latest Star Wars: Battlefront title. In this talk of two halves, Gordy will detail how he isolated John Williams' motifs and then complimented them with his own bridges to create extended themes for the game that were a seamless blend of old and new, which he then recorded along with his own bespoke themes for new locations, whilst David will talk through a few key examples of how the DICE team unwrapped Ben Burtt's original designs and built new systems around these to expand these very specific sounds into fully variable models to work across all facets of the Battlefront universe.

**desc**: Many university game programs face the question: How can we teach our designers to code? It's a significant challenge but as those in the trenches know, the real problem is even harder: How can we teach designers to code without scaring them off? This talk presents findings from four courses addressing this challenge. After a brief review of the course structures and context, the session will describe innovative and successful combinations of technical tools and teaching techniques, as well as some interesting failures. It will conclude with general instructional principles distilled from these efforts and reflection on the implications for diversity in the field.

## Teaching Games With Games 3: Another Six Exercises in Play

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023413/Teaching-Games-With-Games-3
**desc**: One of our best tools for teaching games are games themselves. Name a facet of college-level games education and there is a way to teach it through gameplay. Want to explore continuity and consistency in storytelling? How about shuffling a deck of story cards. Want to think about gender dynamics? Maybe run a street game mod around gender stereotypes. Building on the success of the last two years, six educators will each introduce one classroom exercise they use to teach a different facet of games. The talks span design, programming, art, criticism and even teaching itself.

## Teaching the Social Science-y Bits of Games

**desc**: Participants get a crash course in social science terms and concepts, that they can use when teaching about these parts of games. The talk will cover things like markets, votes, laws, groups, networks (of people not wires!), interests, policies, and so much more! Because social science is so incredibly boring, all examples will be drawn from games about blood sports like hockey and cooking. The goal is to give you a richer toolkit for pointing out these social bits to students and explaining what they contribute to the game.

## Technical Art Culture of 'Uncharted 4'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023251/Technical-Art-Culture-of-Uncharted
**desc**: Technical Art of Uncharted 4 is a hearty reflection on the lessons learned during creation of technology that powers the current gen Art Pipeline of Naughty Dog.Come and learn how we created our interactive foliage animation technology, cloth, hair and fur simulation, custom automated level of detail technology that allowed us to seamlessly render levels the size of our E3 demo, runtime softbody vehicle deformation, automated runtime object population solutions, tool analytics and more. All written almost exclusively within the Art Department.But even more importantly, hear our take on what makes effective technical art, the struggles we had with adoption, why self-induced ignorance can be a creative force, why your are only as good as the best work you will ever throw away, how lack of cross departmental barriers allows you to throw more people at problems without actually having to have more people, how cross-technological communication is the next best thing after interpersonal, why nothing beats the importance of trivial tech work and how core artistic principles directly apply to creating technology.

The talk will be exploring the use of infrastructure management tools such as WPKG, SaltStack, Puppet, and Ansible for the deployment of creative studio pipelines. These tools were originally developed in the field of Dev/Live Ops and we'll explore concrete examples of how to use them in a studio setting for content creation. By strictly defining inheritable states a computer can be in, you open the possibility of taking a computer out of a box and deploying an entire pipeline to it, anywhere in the world, that can evolve as your business needs change.

**desc**: Playdead's INSIDE makes strong use of Temporal Reprojection Anti-Aliasing to deliver satisfactorily clean and stable images. Temporal Reprojection Anti-Aliasing is a spatio-temporal post-process technique, where fragments from the most recent frame are correlated with fragments from a history buffer through reprojection. By carefully jittering the view frustum, and by making sensible choices for when to accept or reject a history sample, this technique can produce images that are superior to the input in terms of information density, because the information in every fragment accumulates over time.This talk will focus on Temporal Reprojection Anti-Aliasing in the context of INSIDE. It will touch on the process, the initial research, and the pleasant side-effects. Most importantly, it will discuss in-depth the individual stages of the implementation written for INSIDE, and how it deals with common problems such as disocclusion and trailing artefacts.

This year the challenge is to design a game that is meant to be played across 30 years that's 11,000 days, or 250,000 hours, or 15 million minutes... A full human generation.Panelists Chris Crawford, founder of the Computer Game Developers Conference, Nina Freeman (Cibele), Zach Gage (Sage Solitaire), and Anna Kipnis (Double Fine Productions) will present their game designs. Why 30 years? We game designers too often think about only the next technology cycle. Designers in other fields - from architects to typeface designers - think of their audiences in terms of decades or even centuries. So what happens when designers take the long view?Come and see what strange and wonderful designs our panelists cook up. And help select the winner of the Game Design Challenge 2016.

**desc**: The 2014-15 Game Outcomes Project was a first-of-its-kind study that analyzed how culture influences outcomes. It found surprisingly strong and consistent correlations between input factors such as teamwork, leadership, crunch/overtime, trust, and respect with discrete project outcomes such as MetaCritic scores, project delays, achievement of project goals, and return-on-investment (ROI).This talk will introduce the 2014-15 Game Outcomes Project, discuss the motivation for the project, the survey design, all the major findings, the limitations (what we can prove, and what we cannot). It will also provide many new insights not covered in the original study results and offer new analyses of the data and what the data tells us.

## The Gothic Horror Music of 'Bloodborne'

**desc**: Bloodborne is a 2015 horror-action RPG directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki (Demon's Soul and Dark Souls), developed by From Software (Japan) and published exclusively on PS4. The game music has received broad critical acclaim for its singular, intense Gothic horror sound performed by large orchestra, choir, soloists, percussion and utilizing extended orchestral techniques. This lecture will examine the musical style and orchestral approaches in the score. We will discuss the dissonant harmony, the horror-inspired melodic gestures, the "wall of sound" approaches and the blood-curdling action music. We will show how the challenging choral writing and the extended orchestral techniques evoked the desperate, disease-plagued City of Yharnam. We will also discuss how the orchestration helped unify the "sound" and aesthetics while working with a multi-cultural creative team (three Japanese staff composers at From Software, and three US guest composers). Additionally, the lecture will examine the communication and logistical challenges inherent with teams based across three continents, and strategies to promote successful musical productions.

## The Lives of Others: How NPCs Can Increase Player Empathy

**desc**: Non-player characters, or NPCs, are an essential part of any video game world. Allies, enemies, and civilians all contribute to make the spaces feel dynamic and realistic. But, more often than not, their lives are meaningless and unguided, their deaths shrugged off as collateral damage, and their very existence erased as soon as the player is out of sight. Rather than treat these characters as background decoration, what if they could be leveraged to increase immersion and deepen player empathy? This session presents case studies from around the industry, including examples from the speaker's own work on Homefront, Far Cry 4, and the recently released Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and suggests best practices for writers and designers looking to maximize the narrative value of these under-appreciated extras.

## Three Statistical Tests Every Game Developer Should Know

**desc**: "How much does this optimization really speed up my game?" can be a difficult question to answer when you're measuring differences of microseconds in highly variable framerates. "When I changed the minimap, 15% fewer playtesters got lost" might have been a fluke - or not - depending on how many testers you tried. Fortunately, statistical techniques exist to turn noisy, real-world sources of data like these into confident answers. This talk is a succint how-to on statistics for answering questions like "does this new camera control scheme make players happier?", "how many players do I need to test this design change on to prove whether it works better?" and "does the framerate really get faster when I do this thing or is it just a fluke of measurement?" We skip past the mathematical background and cut directly to the practical how-to you can use in Excel today.

While a market with greater diversity creates more opportunity for publishers and developers to innovate and find new audiences, it also creates more opportunity to misunderstand the wants of specific player groups. In this talk, EEDAR's VP of Insights, Patrick Walker, will present EEDAR data from a variety of sources, including multiple consumer surveys and gameplay data to explore gamer demographics and engagement patterns across the landscape of different gaming experiences. The presentation will explore actionable patterns in engagement in the context of new experiences (e.g. VR, wearables) new ways to engage (e.g. Early Access, eSports, project backer), and new ways to consume content (e.g. Free-to-Play, Twitch, etc).

## Unified Telemetry, Building an Infrastructure for Big Data in Games Development

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022929/Unified-Telemetry-Building-an-Infrastructure
**desc**: During the development of Rainbow Six Siege, we built a unified infrastructure for metrics and perf capture to centralize collection, processing and storage of every info coming out from our engine and tools: logs, events, scopes, memory and performance captures, aggregated stats, per-frame sampled data, systems' snaphots, and so forth. Unifying all these different information in a single system allowed for big-data analysis, resulting in extremely valuable insights into engine performance, tools usability and human processes. Given the multi-site nature of development at Ubisoft, we designed the system to be completely scalable and be able to continuously record and process gigabytes of data, from every running instance of our game and editors, from all our studios involved across the world. This talk will describe the overall architecture of the system, implementation details for the parts that we built internally, and discuss the third party solutions employed for storage and visualization.

Understanding weaknesses, the way people think and behave, is critical to this. It is important to act on such knowledge with rigor and use it to try and understand the world and game development. This will help to avoid pitfalls and inform decisions about what techniques to use, and which rules to follow and break.

Assassin's Creed Syndicate brought a new challenge to the Ubisoft team. Knowing that carriages would be a core pillar in the navigation of NPCs and players alike, they needed to address a number of issues. This lecture will explain not only how they constructed vehicle AI for navigation, but also how they handled the effect the horse and carriage combo have on the people walking (or fighting) around and on it! They will address the changes they had to make to a variety of systems including pathfinding, navmesh generation, and collision in order to not only support the carriages, but make it an integral part of the overall gameplay experience.

While it is true that the easy problems had all been solved at that point, it just meant that we were finally able to tackle the truly difficult audio programming challenges. In this lecture, we will give a retrospective of what game audio looked like 12 years ago and discuss the current state of the art in audio programming. With that context, we will explore in detail a number of different unsolved problems in game audio and explain what their solutions might look like. Finally, we'll take a look into the crystal ball and present a vision for the future of game audio.

## Writing 'Nothing': Storytelling with Unsaid Words and Unreliable Narrators

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023043/Writing-Nothing-Storytelling-with-Unsaid
**desc**: In King Lear, Shakespeare plays with the idea of 'nothing'. The King asks his daughter to profess her love, and she says that she cannot because her love is not the kind that easily becomes words - she says 'nothing' instead. The King replies that 'nothing shall come of nothing', and it is his lack of understanding for the value of the inexpressible that brings his downfall. For viewers of King Lear, the 'play' is both the activity on the stage and the interpretation of the words to form a coherent interpretation of the lines that are spoken. This form of play, using story interpretation as a mechanic of gameplay, is currently underused in video games, and a strong area for exploration. In our writing for games, we are tempted to put everything onto the page, with all motivations clearly and explicitly stated for the player to understand. The teams we work with may worry that players won't be able to follow stories with nuance or implied meanings, but to push our medium further we need to work with ambiguity in the lives of our characters and allow players to fill in the absences. Where sentences trail off, lines are interrupted, or silence used, the player will naturally search for meaning in our words (or lack thereof). We can use these traits in our writing to take it beyond being dressing for traditional gameplay activities and towards making the full comprehension of the relationships between the characters part of the game's appeal. In complement to the concept of leaving words unsaid, games have huge potential to expand notions of unreliable narrators. This writing technique has been used with great success in many famous works of literature, from the framing devices of 'Frankenstein' and 'Wuthering Heights', to the delusional Patrick Batemen in 'American Psycho'. There are two forms of this that can be of use to us: characters who see themselves differently from how the player is expected to see them, and characters whose reality we see but don't trust.

**desc**: The recent rise in prominence of indie developers and small to mid-tier studios has brought with it a new generation of publishers, marketing partners, indie labels, and other spins on the traditional publisher. While no developer truly needs a publisher these days there are legitimate reasons for an indie dev to partner with one and this session will discuss some of the less obvious things to look for when assessing these notorious jackals.

## You Hear That? Team Engagement for Audio

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023203/You-Hear-That-Team-Engagement
**desc**: Audio teams are often frustrated by a lack of support and understanding from their dev teams. This talk hopes to present ways to turn that frustration into cooperation by presenting a series of easy (and fun) ways audio team memebers can engage with their larger development teams early to provide audio direction to the project and enjoy a cascading benefit of knowledge through education. Using anecdotes and examples of various useful engagement practices for audio teams, this talk aims to show how these practices can pay huge dividends in getting entire teams to think about and be excited about the audio of a project from pre-production onward.

## You're Not Alone: A Backend Technology Solution Survey

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023445/You-re-Not-Alone-A
**desc**: Developers no longer need to build the backend for a F2P game from scratch; nowadays there are hundreds of vendors in categories such as attribution tracking, advertising, customer service, localization, predictive analytics, A/B testing, tax calculations, profanity filtering, payment processing, and more.This session will survey this ever-growing ecosystem, reviewing the leaders, and suggesting common scenarios that require linking technologies together. This is a "pedal meets the metal" talk on the reality of implementing an actual backend to support high-level concepts that other speakers in this summit will talk about, like boosting monetization, doing effective user acquisition, or using analytics effectively.

## [Continuous] Delivery Pipelines via Docker

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023327/-Continuous-Delivery-Pipelines-via
**desc**: Development teams at Riot own their entire production pipeline - from the first line of code to worldwide deployment. No one outside their team is required at any stage of the process, drastically reducing the time from project conception through delivery to players. This talk covers the technical details of Riot's utilization of Docker to solve problems at all stages of that pipeline. Among other benefits, containerization has allowed Riot engineers to simulate production scenarios locally, create on-demand disposable build environments, and deploy more simply and predictably.
