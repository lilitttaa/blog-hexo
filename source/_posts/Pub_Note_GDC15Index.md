## A Live Art Demonstration of Creating Worlds through Design Thinking

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021752/A-Live-Art-Demonstration-of
**desc**: In the competitive world of video game development, less and less time is given for 2d pre-production. Concept designers must balance their schedule between envisioning new ideas verses executing professional drawings and paintings. And with so many games entering the market every year, it is also harder and harder to come up with original contents. During the first half of this session, Feng will share his methods for idea generation. We'll explore a variety of quick and efficient design thinking techniques to help expand your imagination. In the second half, Feng will jump into Photoshop and demonstrate the first few stages of concept design. The aim is to produce a large number of digital paintings within a very short amount of time. We'll also involve the audience during this process and shouting out questions is definitely welcomed. Bring your sketchbooks and let's draw.

**desc**: At the Game Changer Chicago Design Lab at The University of Chicago, we pride ourselves on a new, unique and community-inclusive R&D process. We have started a new Experimental Games Group to include a large number of young students interested in game design, and prototype ideas in short production cycles. This Experimental Games Group has become a spectacularly fun, collaborative and productive process for our lab. The group meets once a week and is open to participants at any age and skill level. The process begins with a guest lecturer from the University giving a casual presentation (topics have included Youth Violence, Healthcare Disparities, Improving Neighborhoods, and more); the group then proceeds through a collaborative brainstorming phase, and ends with a guest CS student prototyping a rough version of the game that the group has agreed upon. Each production cycle lasts for one month.

**desc**: With the advent of Kickstarter and Early Access, many teams are now developing their games in the open, providing beta, alpha, and even prototype builds to any player willing to buy in early. In this panel, four game developers who have direct experience with open development will share their experiences with this method.How often should the players be updated to the current version? How best to communicate changes and new features to players? How does the team filter the waves of online feedback? What happens when players express displeasure over a change? How important is it to remind players about what is still missing from the game? How do the project leads ensure that feedback from the players is heard and valued while making sure that the developers can still do their jobs? Once a game has been publicly available for so long, how to ensure that the actual release is still an important event?

**desc**: Games are a form of media that can be used for many things. Sure, we love using games for entertainment. Who doesn't? Over 90% of America's youth play games. But why do we stick so doggedly to this notion that using games for anything else is some peculiar blasphemy? Do you think the same way about movies? Books? Games are still maturing. Games for entertainment? Absolutely. But let's unshackle games from our expectations of what they have to be or not be. Let's harness their unique features to help teach our children complex subjects, to motivate each other to become healthier, and to conduct scientific research collectively. Games are capable of so much. Don't we owe it to the art form to explore all its possibilities fully? How is your government exploring games as a form of media, and how can you get involved to shape that future?

## Adaptive Virtual Texture Rendering in Far Cry 4

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021760/Adaptive-Virtual-Texture-Rendering-in
**desc**: This lecture will present a novel technique called Adaptive Virtual Texture (AVT) rendering which is used in Far Cry 4. It will describe how we used the technique to render terrain along with a massive amount of decals very efficiently on both CPU and GPU. Traditional virtual texture rendering techniques like MegaTexture and procedural virtual texturing can suffer from low-texel resolution when applied to a large open world. Adaptive virtual texturing overcomes this problem. In Far Cry 4 it is used in a 10KM*10KM world, and achieves 10 texels/cm resolution, which is 20 times higher than traditional virtual texturing techniques.

## Advanced VR Rendering

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021772/Advanced-VR
**desc**: Valve has been creating advanced prototype VR HMD's since mid-2013 that are more advanced than other developers currently have access to, and this head start has allowed us to gain a ton of VR-specific rendering knowledge that we'd like to share with developers who are actively working on VR or plan to in the near future. This talk will start with the base requirements of VR rendering, and it will progress into advanced rendering topics focusing on both performance and visual quality. First generation consumer HMD's are expected to require renderers to shade over 4 million pixels per frame at a minimum of 90 fps. Due to the wide FOV of these HMD's, each pixel ends up feeling lower resolution than viewing the same image on a monitor and requires better shading algorithms than rendering in non-VR. Higher resolution rendering and higher quality pixels at much higher frame rates than games traditionally target is cause for taking a step back and rethinking many aspects of rendering. Some topics that will be covered include: efficient stereo rendering, reducing rendering latency, saturating the GPU despite synchronization points, reducing pixel cost for low-priority pixels, specular antialiasing, constrained anisotropic lighting, and other tips and tricks relating directly to VR rendering performance and quality.

## Analyzing the Steam Marketplace Using Publicly Derived Sales Estimates

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021787/Analyzing-the-Steam-Marketplace-Using
**desc**: While Steam represents a huge chunk of the overall PC games market, there hasn't been a public, NPD-style service providing detailed overall sales estimates for the entirety of the service - until now. The "Steam Gauge" project samples tens of thousands of public Steam Community profiles to generate accurate enough estimates of aggregate sales and gameplay hours for every game on the service. This session will provide an in-depth analysis of that data, and what it tells us about the state of today's PC gaming market. We'll show how things like Metacritic rankings and discounts affect game sales, and look at which games are played more (or less) than their raw sales numbers would suggest, and much more. After this session, Steam will no longer be an opaque box in which sales and gameplay data is forever hidden, but an open glass case ready to reveal its secrets.

## Animation Bootcamp: Refining A Mechanic's Personality

**desc**: Animation is often thought of as an art task, a layer of polish. In the low budget and indie sectors, it's often one of the first areas to be cut down for financial reasons. This talk focuses on the way in which design, code, VO and mechanical context can be used in tandem with animation to create character and performance, and allow for budget to be spent where it counts - creating unique characters. Thomas Was Alone will be used as an initial case study, before moving on to the ways in which MoCap, animation and design have been combined to tell stories and convey personality in Volume.

## Applying Machine Learning Like a Responsible Adult

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021802/Applying-Machine-Learning-Like-a
**desc**: Game AI developers tend to treat machine learning with a mixture of curiosity, skepticism and dismissal. There's a widespread perception that certain unique aspects of game AI make it a poor fit for ML. However, game AI is far from unique in its needs. The generally bad experiences game AI has had with ML are primarily due to a lack of knowledge about the necessary tools and techniques rather than a failing of the technique itself. Simply understanding these tools and techniques, however, often helps game devs get beyond the suspicion and reluctance and use machine learning techniques to improve their games. This lecture will describe key concepts from ML, such as over-fitting and the bias/variance tradeoff, and the problem spaces (supervised/unsupervised, classification versus regression, etc.). We will then give a quick overview of several common and valuable ML algorithms.

A tiny team of artists at Hello Games is using procedural technology to create the infinite worlds of No Man's Sky.

Like many artists, they were very cynical about procedural art, thinking that the loss of control inevitably leads to inferior art. They were so very wrong!

The results were extraordinary. Given real printing deadlines and a $20-$25 maximum budget, designers encountered new limits they were forced to overcome with design -- and became better designers as a result. Through case studies and lessons learned, veteran producer instructor Jesse Vigil discusses how elements of manufacturing and publishing changed the processes and habits of novice students for the better.

## Building a Better Centaur: AI at Massive Scale

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021848/Building-a-Better-Centaur-AI
**desc**: Today's MMOs often have hundreds of types of agents in their game world - each with potentially dozens of actions they can take. Hand crafting the AI for every agent can be a time-consuming process fraught with brittle, unpredictable results. Often, the only way to achieve the breadth of characters is to sacrifice the depth of behaviors that they can take. This session will show a new architecture that combines a modular, utility-based AI system and a powerful influence map engine. With it, agents are not only far more intelligent than prior iterations, but use significantly less processing time. This allows us to put not only smarter creatures in the world, but more of them as well. We will also show the tools that allow designers to create unique, expressive behaviors for hundreds of character types in a fraction of the time that it previously took - often creating new, unique character behavior packages in minutes rather than hours!

## Cinematic Games Are Dead! Long Live Cinematic Games!

Clever uses of art, interface and UX can make an experience "cinematic" without ever having a single camera cut, and make players walk away feeling like they visited a movie like it was a place.

**desc**: Building a game that people play for years is no simple task and has no magic formula. However, in this session, Clash of Clans developer, Jonas Collaros, takes an insider's look at the hit game's development history and asks: what lessons can Clash teach?The mobile, free-to-play marketplace is rife with challenges, even for veteran developers, but, Jonas explains, perhaps the greatest challenge is maintaining a focus on essentials. A project's essential needs change again and again, especially over the span of years. Exploring the "three eras" of Clash development, Jonas reveals the specific needs, challenges, and pitfalls they encountered along the way.Clash developers value a critical eye towards essential needs, eschewing project roadmaps in favor of simply playing the game and focusing relentlessly on "what matters most." This focused development, by extension, is what Jonas claims has resulted in a game that keeps the interest of players year after year.

## Classic Game Postmortem: Adventure

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021861/Classic-Game-Postmortem
**desc**: Warren Robinett, the veteran programmer, designer and The Learning Company founder known for his groundbreaking game design work at Atari, TLC and NASA, is coming to GDC 2015 to deliver a Classic Game Postmortem on the creation of his hit 1979 game Adventure for the Atari 2600 console. Adventure is particularly notable for (among other things) being one of the first graphical action-adventure games ever released. Adventure also contained one of the earliest known "Easter eggs" ever hidden in a game by a designer -- in this case, a hidden screen revealing Robinett's name and authorship at a time when Atari was unwilling to publicly credit game makers for their work. Thus his efforts to create Adventure meaningfully advanced both the practice of game development and the fight for developers to be recognized for their work. The talk is about the implementation of Adventure. For clarity, the game code has been translated into C (from its original 6502 assembler code). Because memory was extremely expensive in the late 70's, the program for Adventure had to fit into a 4K-byte ROM chip. Therefore the program was very short -- barely a dozen pages of C code. The game had 30 rooms, and 18 objects of 12 different types -- the square Man (the player's avatar), the Chalice (the Grail-like goal of the game), 3 castles with matching keys to open them, 3 dragons and a sword to kill them, a bat that flew in and stole your stuff, a magnet that attracted things, several mazes and a bridge that let you cross its walls. How was all this jammed into 4K? A good data structure was the heart of the game: the room-list and object-list. There was also a very effective "Behavioristic" scheme for giving "desires" and "fears" to the creatures in the game (which caused them to flee from or pursue certain other objects). For more implementation details, see the E-book "The Annotated Adventure" (warrenrobinett.com/adventure). Within this highly-compressed code can be seen the skeleton of the modern adventure game, boiled down to its essentials.

Now he's coming to GDC in March to speak at length about the development of Loom, a remarkably mature fantasy with an innovative musical interface, and a flexible, beginner-friendly design that was the first to embody what would become the LucasArts philosophy: that players should never have to deal with dead ends, accidental deaths or forced restarts. His lecture will survey the entire history of the project, from conception to shipping, together with amusing production anecdotes, little-known facts, and rare artifacts from his personal collection of Lucasfilm memorabilia

A contemporary renaissance man, Warshaw has leapt between several successful careers in the past few decades and currently works as a licensed psychotherapist in addition to performing speaking engagements and serving as a contributing artist to New York's Museum of Modern Art. His efforts at Atari in the '80s helped advance the practice of game design, and he played a role in some of the pivotal events of industry history. His work on Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the earliest examples of highly successful licensed game development; the unreasonable pressures put upon him to create a game with the E.T. license led to a financial failure that presaged the North American game industry crash of 1983. Now he's coming to GDC to speak at length about his work designing and coding Yars' Revenge, widely believed to be one of the best Atari 2600 games ever made. He'll also make time to speak about his work on E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and answer questions from GDC attendees.

Calling on her brief stint as a stand-up comedian and less brief stint as a current comedy game developer, Zoe Quinn looks to examine comedy's role in games, define what a comedy game is, discuss how to tell jokes through mechanics, and explore the unique concerns of developing, testing and marketing a game that uses comedy as its primary ethos. Through the examination and discussion of process, this talk looks to encourage more developers to experiment in the genre of comedy, while likely telling a handful of dumb jokes along the way.

For instance, Counter-Strike levels should always reward players and teams for skillful play, while at the same time providing ample opportunities for individual and team creativity. Collaborating with professional players and other experts is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of the specific game mechanics unique to Counter-Strike. Modern level designers must also understand the relationship of art design to a competitive experience: the form of a CS level should match the function of that level, such that there is no point at which level art exists only for art's sake, or is detrimental to gameplay.

Even for the most seasoned professional, the creative process is something we, as human beings, can't control but only participate in. Creative pros need to harness this creative process in a predictable way, so that they can deliver their work on time. Veteran game composer Tom Salta will offer a rare glimpse into his creative process by sharing a revealing play-by-play, and reflective account of his creative process on various projects. Inspired by a fellow composer's request for Tom to document his creative process. Tom kept a daily journal capturing rare insights and observations that composers are generally too busy, or too secretive, to document or offer reflections on - everything from the dreaded "blank slate/blue sky" phase to the "panicked sprint to the finish."

## Creating Safe Spaces at Game Events

**desc**: The games industry has made great strides when it comes to talking openly about diversity and discrimination. But simply wanting to promote inclusivity isn't enough. For women, queer folk, and people of color, gaming events and communities often still feel like unwelcoming places where they'll be judged or simply silenced. How do we turn our good intentions into actionable change? By creating safe spaces for gamers of all stripes to participate and have their voices heard.A safe space is an environment where participants are free to be themselves without fear of discrimination. The speakers on this panel organize some the most prominent and innovative safe-space events in gaming. Drawing candidly from both their successes and their missteps, the panelists will share ten key lessons that can turn any event or workplace into a safe space.

**desc**: In this session, we will discuss the challenges of developing a truly scalable game engine - current gen console to embedded devices - with our panel of industry veterans.How does the wide range of device capabilities affect art pipelines? Do the reduced-overhead APIs, such as Apple's Metal, enable features that would not be possible with traditional APIs? Is the cost of supporting an increasing number of graphics APIs becoming a development bottleneck? Is it feasible for small studios to take on this challenge, or is it only cost effective for large-scale game and middleware development?

## Deliberately Developmental Leadership

**desc**: Founding a game studio is just the first step in a long line of decisions that will determine the quality and success of your games, company culture and work experience as a whole. In the talk, I will introduce the core principals of the DDO: Deliberately Developmental Organization, as outlined in several Harvard Business Review articles - which include letting each person outline their own developmental goals, and working from a place of transparency with respect to individual and group challenges as an organization in the areas of communication, collaboration, coaching and receiving feedback. Core to the talk will be the perspective that while it is more costly to run a DDO in the short term (ie: time spent on personal development, iterating on internal process, speed of hiring and organizational growth, etc) it is a benefit in the longer term. Funomena is a DDO, but it is also a company focused on building a diverse community of development. Supplemental lessons in this talk will reflect on the challenges of diverse hiring and retention of new voices - sometimes from outside of the development community at large.

## Designing for Empathy with Sensory Replication in D4

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021912/Designing-for-Empathy-with-Sensory
**desc**: D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die is the latest thriller from SWERY, the eccentric mind behind the 2010 cult hit Deadly Premonition. In this session, he will discuss the development of D4 and his attempts to empathetically connect to players using a design method called "sensory replication." One of the core design goals in D4 was to engage players at an emotional level. Another was to find a way to allow players who hate motion controls to enjoy the game using a Kinect. After much trial and error, SWERY and his team at Access Games realized that these two goals could be addressed at the same time. The answer was a game design pattern called "sensory replication." Sensory replication attempts to connect the player to the moment-to-moment events on the screen at a visceral level. When it works, the empathetic impact is dramatic. However, building a game around sensory replication is difficult, and its effects are not guaranteed. In this talk, SWERY will discuss the theory behind sensory replication and show how it influenced his design of D4. In addition, he'll talk about how building this game forced him to reevaluate many of his preconceived notions about game design.

## Designing for Mobile VR in Dead Secret

**desc**: Mobile VR, like desktop VR, comes with a set of unique design challenges. The playing field is wide open when it comes to designing VR-centric gameplay systems, but the stakes are high: poorly implemented designs often result in the player feeling sick. Good VR also requires competent 3D graphics running at a rock solid frame rate. Building an interesting and convincing virtual space on mobile hardware is a tricky proposition. In the summer of 2014, Robot Invader decided to rebuild its current project, a moody murder mystery called Dead Secret, as a mobile VR game. Originally designed for tablets, the title was rebuilt from the ground up to accommodate mobile VR. From the pacing to the interface, the sound system to the monetization plan, everything changed. After months of work, Dead Secret is not only playable on mobile VR platforms, it's a much better game. This talk will discuss the challenges and benefits of targeting mobile VR platforms, and discuss in detail how mobile developers can approach this new platform. This talk is focused on specific design considerations for mobile VR, the decisions we made in Dead Secret, tips and tricks we learned along the way, and how we might do it differently in the future.

**desc**: Modern indie-friendly frameworks like Unity use physics engines (like Box2D or PhysX) to simulate the game world. That makes it easy to prototype your game, except that when you want hard collisions between heavy objects, everything glitches out and explodes. You can't tune it to feel tight or realistic, and you wind up with a game that feels 'floaty'. You don't want to get a degree in advanced physics, you just want to know how to make your game feel solid without writing your own physics engine. I've stopped making floaty games and I'm here to help you do the same.

The more he explored their intentions the more he saw patterns in the design teams that failed or succeeded. The final conclusion: it takes all kinds and the best design teams are well rounded. This session explores Richard's theory on game designer types. The talk will describe his experience with the four major types, how to identify them, and how to determine their skill level. Then the talk will discuss which designers are ideal for what positions -- which are leaders and which are doers. This talk will help game designers better understand themselves, their growth, and what roles they can play on a design team. Also, recruiters and producers can learn how to build better design teams.

## Desire Is Not a Dirty Word: Writing Healthy Fanservice in Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021925/Desire-Is-Not-a-Dirty
**desc**: The word "fanservice" has somewhat of an unsavory history in the context of games, associated with shallow writing, harmful sexism and titillation for "horny fanboys." Yet sexual desire is a natural, multi-faceted part of many people's lives, and just like any other artistic medium, games can and should be willing to not just explore, but inspire that emotion. In this talk, writers, designers and other game developers will be given a useful six-point toolset on how to evoke desire in their games by writing and presenting sexy content in a way that's healthy, diverse and nuanced - not to mention fun and hot!

## Destiny's Multithreaded Rendering Architecture

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021926/Destiny-s-Multithreaded-Rendering
**desc**: Modern console architectures have heterogeneous, multi-core computation architectures that differ vastly in performance and memory characteristics. As a result, game engine architectures have moved away from thread-level parallelism to use 'job systems' for fine-grained task and data parallelism. To optimally take advantage of all available resources, a game engine must be designed from the ground up for job-based multithreading.In this talk we will delve into the renderer that Bungie developed for Destiny, a fast-paced shared world shooter for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One and Xbox 360. We will describe the architecture of a multithreaded renderer that delivers low-latency, efficient execution across multiple platforms, focusing on both the successes and challenges encountered. This talk will not cover the specific GPU rendering techniques used in Destiny but will cover the implications for features designed in this multithreaded architecture.

**desc**: Since game developers are skilled knowledge workers in project-based environments, it is assumed that they seek individual solutions to their employment challenges. However, recent data shows that many game developers are interested in workplace or industry representation and collective action. In a 2014 survey, 43.5% of the sample agreed or strongly agreed that they would rather raise workplace problems through an employee organization than as an individual. The same survey found that 36.3% of the sample would vote for a union at their studio and 55.7% would vote "yes" for an industry-wide union like the actors' or writers' unions. This talk will present data from surveys and interviews with game developers over a 10-year span to document trends in quality of life and working conditions. It will present attitudes towards collective representation to elicit debate about the viability of more robust collective action among game developers.

## Doing Business in Europe: EU Regulations and Public Relations

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021937/Doing-Business-in-Europe-EU
**desc**: Europe is a lucrative market for F2P games, but it does not necessarily function like other 1st world markets. In particular, the regulatory and PR landscapes differ from the North American and Asian counterparts in ways that developers would be wise to understand before diving headfirst into Europe. (Note: this session is composed of two separate 30 minute lectures, beginning with the lecture on regulations and closing with PR, for those attendees who only have interest in one topic.)The regulations focused portion will delve into recent developments in the regulation of advertising directed at children which is having an impact on games for all ages because of the broad interpretation by consumer watchdogs. Under European law a direct exhortation to children to buy an advertised product is forbidden. In the broadest interpretation applied by a high level court this includes commonly used prompts to buy or spend virtual currency or items. The lecture will introduce examples and how to avoid conflicts with the law. Examples are taken from "Runes of Magic", "Candy Crush Saga", "Boom Beach", "Littlest Pet Shop" and "Bejeweled HD".The PR focused portion will explore a mix of real-world anecdotes and data driven analysis of the ways in which PR has been used effectively in a number of European F2P PC games. It will provide concrete tips on how to approach your PR strategy in general. Attendees should be able to leave the portion with a much better understanding of how media approach F2P games and on how to communicate on their own projects.

Russ would be granted full access to every member of the development team and be an embedded reporter at the studio during the development of Defense Grid 2. With total access to every member of the development team, Pitts provided total transparency about the making of DG2 over a series of multiple articles and most recently, a full-length book.For Jeff and the development team, this level of openness would come with great risk, but also an immense opportunity to connect with their potential audience, promote awareness of what goes into making a modern video game and establish expectations in a way that no other studio ever has.Join Jeff Pobst to learn more about this unique arrangement, the opportunity, the hesitation, the challenges, the benefits, the untold stories that result from being completely transparent during development.

**desc**: The success of games like League of Legends and SWTOR show that free-to-play games are not coming to AAA entertainment sometime in the distant future - the future is now. F2P can lead to massive success, but if done carelessly, can alienate your consumer base. In this talk, Damion Schubert describes lessons learned from SWTOR's wildly successful conversion to F2P. Topics will include: building team buy-in of the new world order, rethinking how your customer base is divided, maximizing spend from happy whales, and most importantly, how success still depends on players falling in love with your game.

## Encouraging Engagement in Large and Extra, Extra Large Courses

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021957/Encouraging-Engagement-in-Large-and
**desc**: Creating one course suitable to classes of 36, 400, and 25,000 students is a daunting task. This is particularly true in games studies, which by its very nature almost requires interactive, resource-intensive course material. A key challenge is maintaining student engagement, especially in such extra large classes. This talk addresses an effort to meet that challenge at the University of Alberta. "Understanding Video Games," a course developed in collaboration with BioWare, had three successes and one lovely, messy failure in improving student engagement. Successes derive from involving students in game-like activities and then transforming these activities into objects of study.

**desc**: Shipping multiple game seasons with episodic DLC on 8 simultaneous platforms presents many challenges. One of those challenges is maximizing performance and quality on each of those platforms without needing an army of people to address the pixel density, texture formats, and model complexity. In this presentation, Zac Litton, VP of Engineering at Telltale, is going to give an overview of how Telltale handles this through automation and tuning. In particular, he will look at how Simplygon integrated into this pipeline for their recent hit games, Game of Thrones and Tales from the Borderlands, just a few weeks before submission. It will show the challenges of integration and how they were overcome to build an adaptive process for reducing model complexity to improve performance. The session will also contain an overview of Simplygon's features and how it integrates with off the shelf tools and internal tech.

Arkham Asylum plus Pokemon?", we continued push working towards a feeling rather than a particular mechanic or structure. We'll discuss the difficulties we had explaining how these disparate concepts could make sense and our methods, both successful and unsuccessful, for getting the team to help us manifest this feeling into gameplay mechanics and settings, as well as exercises we used to break the team out of conventional thinking.

Today, 111 years later, technology has advanced in amazing ways and yet we still struggle with that basic challenge to create characters that feel compelling and real, grounded in and aware of the world around them, and believably "alive."

We'll explain how we massively reduced the compile time of our 2.5M lines of C++ code to under a minute. We'll describe how we built a network cache for "binarized" assets on commodity PCs, outperforming million-dollar commercial hardware. We'll show how we used this asset store to speed up our data builds, and how we accelerated our package distribution to be instantaneous for hundreds of concurrent users. Finally, we'll show the tools we've built to allow patching a running instance of the game with locally modified assets for rapid content iteration.

## Finding Balance: Realizing Responsive High Fidelity Character Movement in Just Cause 3

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021981/Finding-Balance-Realizing-Responsive-High
**desc**: Character movement in games usually suffers from design requiring highly responsive movement, versus animation that requires time to convey energy, momentum and intention. In addition, when needing to support a vast array of feature sets with limited budgets, the costs of producing large amounts of animation and in-game memory become increasing concerns. This talk will discuss a philosophy and a range of techniques revolving around preserving animation content and creating coverage through the use of correcting and manipulating motion. Using specific use-cases as examples from our upcoming title, Just Cause 3, we will demonstrate the techniques used to maintain responsiveness and preserve animation quality. Jeet will showcase the importance of authoring content with the technology in mind and explore ways to reduce animation content and memory usage by highlighting some of the key features of our character motion and animation systems. During the Q&A our lead animator will also be present to answer any specific questions pertaining to our content.

## Forced-Based Anticipatory Collision Avoidance in Crowd Simulations

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1021986/Forced-Based-Anticipatory-Collision-Avoidance
**desc**: As game worlds get bigger and more populated, animating crowds of interacting characters is becoming an increasingly common task in modern computer games. Traditionally, this problem involves both rendering/animating individuals and planning their paths through the dynamic environment. Our focus is on the latter problem of computing 2D trajectories for agents, allowing them to steer towards their goals, while simultaneously avoiding upcoming collisions in an intelligent and realistic-looking fashion. The lecture will first give a brief overview of state-of the-art, velocity-based approaches (e.g., RVO and ORCA) summarizing both their advantages and drawbacks. We will then introduce a new, force-based method for anticipatory collision avoidance that follows directly from our current research in statistically analyzing human trajectories. We will show how this method avoids many of the potential pitfalls of velocity-based approaches, is easy to implement, and can be directly incorporated into existing force-based simulation pipelines.

Do games ignore the laws of war because simulating it would not be fun? Or because it's a new and untested idea? Games outside of a battlefield setting have been made more challenging and fun by simulating the negative consequences for player actions (Grand Theft Auto). Can games be more fun if they enorce the Geneva Convention through gameplay?

NavMesh is the popular navigation representation for most games and it does a really good job for agents who move along the ground. However, it doesn't really work for agents who fly in any direction in 3D space. In developing the ArchWing space battles for Warframe, full 3D flight navigation and avoidance was required to function in a mix of sparse asteroid fields and the tight, complex confines of wrecked capital ship debris.

## Goal-Oriented Action Planning: Ten Years Old and No Fear!

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022462/Goal-Oriented-Action-Planning-Ten
**desc**: Monolith released their game F.E.A.R. in 2005. At GDC 2006, Jeff Orkin showed us how his Goal-Oriented Action Planner system (GOAP) powered the AI for F.E.A.R. in a way that was new and fresh. In the past 10 years since, GOAP has had its ups and downs, still trying to find its way among the traditional AI algorithms. While architecturally simple, it has had to adapt to handle the demands of each new generation of AAA games.

**desc**: Monolith released their game F.E.A.R. in 2005. At GDC 2006, Jeff Orkin showed us how his Goal-Oriented Action Planner system (GOAP) powered the AI for F.E.A.R. in a way that was new and fresh. In the past 10 years since, GOAP has had its ups and downs, still trying to find its way among the traditional AI algorithms. While architecturally simple, it has had to adapt to handle the demands of each new generation of AAA games.

## Hermes: Extensible REST and RPC Communication for Games Features

However, the direction to take in this regard was unclear. The root problem was a diverse combination of game feature requirements, environments and team developer preferences that meant that a "one-size-fits-all" approach was unworkable. This talk presents and discusses our solution, Hermes. It is an extensible (Java-based) communications system that allows each game feature team to customize the facilities to match very closely with their requirements. The talk explains how Hermes is extended, and how each team can customize it for their own feature without compromising interoperability.

It will also demo Maxis' MUiLE editor as an example of building a JS-based UI editor for quick iteration without requiring designers know the intricacies of HTML and CSS.

## How to Make and Self-Publish a Game in 12 Months

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022056/How-to-Make-and-Self
**desc**: Making your first game as a new indie studio means that on top of actually making the game, you've got to do pretty much everything yourself. Self-fund, self-market, self-publish, self-incorporate, self-everything. This talk will chronicle that crucial first year as we made our first game and prepared if for a cross-platform PC and tablet release. There were some great moments and some harsh lessons in that year, with great advice from other game dev friends and mentors. This presentation will share everything that we learned.

**desc**: Challenged with creating a compelling narrative for ACU 4-player COOP missions, the Toronto Cinematic team, who had just finished Splinter Cell Blacklist scripted events, had to try something completely different. The intros needed to occupy a different space than the AC single player experience, yet feel connected to the brand and SP campaign! Characters and story, Robert McKee said, are actually the same thing so stop arguing about which is more important. COOP could be played in any order so a linear story with story arcs was out of the question. Our stories, had to be totally mission contained, and themes would instead be carried across the whole campaign. So we chose to build our mission intros like trailers for missions, and boiled them down to their absolute essence. Every step of our process was about distilling the dialogue, narration and character actions down to sharp, dynamic and short mission intros that contained the highest level of SEE-SAY possible. Our vision statement became "ignite gameplay" and this informed every aspect of our production. This presentation takes the audience step by step through our blueprint, elevator pitches, style guide, cinematic vision documents, treatments, first pass intro, storyboards, pre-visualization with scratch audio, and then to the animation and script team moving to in-engine pre-visualization.

The lecture will describe in what cases it gives advantages over morph geometries and bone-driven modifications. Direct manipulation allows users to create sims of their choice by tugging and pulling on the character directly. The system is built around data-driven selectors and modifiers that include morph targets, bones-driven deformations and deformation maps for shape manipulations. Smart randomization allows automated generation of sims with consistent look by putting together assets that match certain attributes.

**desc**: It has been said that "pathfinding is a solved problem." Just because something is "solved" doesn't mean it can't be improved especially with regards to execution time. Normally, a speed gain of 10x or 100x over a traditional algorithm is unheard of. Recently, a method has been devised that is capable of doing just that to A*. In 2011, Harabor and Grastien introduced Jump Point Search (JPS) that achieves up to a 10x speed improvement over A* on uniform cost grids. In the last year, an additional 10x speed improvement to JPS, called JPS+ was independently developed by Steve Rabin as well as Harabor and Grastien. This improved algorithm is over 100x faster than A* on maps with open areas and over 2x faster than A* on worst-case maps. This incredible speed-up is due to pre-computation, eliminating the recursion in JPS and focusing only on touching select relevant nodes during the search.

## Keep the Game Running: A Modern Asset Pipeline (Presented by Simplygon and Platinum Games)

**desc**: Many game productions have failed due to an over optimistic view of what can be done at the end stages of the projects. Memory and performance issues surface late, which leaves little time to take corrective actions. In the end the game quality and team suffers from all the stressed decisions that are made in final months of the production. The importance of continuously keeping the game at a state indicative of the final product, cannot be underestimated. This is even more urgent with the new generation of consoles, where the extended graphic and memory capacity leading to even bigger productions.This session will highlight problems that can come out of pushing things to the end of the game project. Things such as, extended crunches and delayed releases due to performance issues and hidden problems, games cancelled at internal reviews due to product not showing well. Finally this can lead to losing talent due to poor working conditions and financial issues.At the end of the session, we will provide a solutions on how to keep the game at a good state without wasting time on unnecessary optimization work at an early stage in production. Showing a modern asset pipeline that describes how the game can be reach and maintain a representative state at an early stage of the production.

## Lessons from the Core Engine Architecture of Destiny

**desc**: At Bungie, we built games based on the Halo engine for ten years. However, by 2008 it was beginning to show its age and there were many core systems that were ill-suited to a modern game development environment. For our new game, Destiny, we sought to develop an engine that would last us just as long as the Halo engine had. This talk will cover the six-year development arc of the Destiny engine, from inception to ship. We will cover various lessons learned during the course of Destiny engine development, including techniques for large-scale engine refactoring, educating a team of engineers about intentions behind system architecture, how to test assumptions early, and topics in applied system architecture such as data lifetime management, object system design and source code layering. Each lesson will be illustrated by development history and system designs drawn from the Destiny engine.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022130/Making-It-to-Break-It
**desc**: Hack 'n' Slash is game about hacking and reverse engineering that re-contextualizes actual hacking tools and techniques as mechanics in the style of a classic top-down action-adventure game. Its unique structure necessitated a distinctive approach to game design that led to some key insights about finding Hack 'n' Slash's soul, and about game design in general. This presentation will cover dealing with mechanics that allow players to subvert your design, adapting tools and techniques from another domain (in this case, reverse engineering) for a game, and using teaching curriculums as a lens for puzzle design.

## Marketing Indie Style

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022140/Marketing-Indie
**desc**: For those who want to earn a regular income from indie games, marketing can be as vital to success as the game itself. Some look at this in the abstract -- as something that they should get to at some point. Too frequently, they never dive in to it at all, or do so very late. This session provides expert advice from two perspectives: a marketer who's driven launches for both high-profile/high-budget releases and smaller enthusiast games, and an indie who's been heavily involved in the community, notably through his own game. The two speakers work together on the Media Indie Exchange mixer events for indies, press and industry.

We will go over how we created a pooling system that allowed us to swap from low-res NPCs to high-res NPCs without the player noticing. This talk will then explain how to create a simplistic AI brain to animate the thousands of NPCs. With the limit of 40 real AIs and 120 high resolution models, we could successfully create a scene where 10,000 crowd NPCs are on screen at the same time.

## Measuring and Manipulating Player Trust through Choice and Game Mechanics

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022154/Measuring-and-Manipulating-Player-Trust
**desc**: Trust is a fundamental aspect of society and is vitally important to multiplayer games and social networks. Although reputation metrics have been well established in many areas of the game industry, from measuring player skill to ensuring that players who are nice to others have a positive social experience playing with others, relatively little work has been done on trust in games. Trust systems build on reputation systems in that they attempt to determine how players will behave in new situations. This lecture will present results from research in computational aspects of trust and reputation. It will show how "trust" can be formalized mathematically using decision theory and game theory, and then directly applied to game mechanics and player metrics. We will then provide an overview of how these techniques can be employed in games to create more believable NPCs, improve player experience, create new experiences, and increase player retention.

This talk describes in detail how we reduced the turnaround time on iOS and Android to an average of 40 seconds. The topic of the second part of the presentation is the design and implementation of our file streaming system that allowed us to update game assets such as Lua scripts, shaders and effects in real-time on a mobile device running Broken Age.

**desc**: The next evolution of multiplayer game design and community building is to give players the tools to build their own online communities and moderate them. To show the impact of this philosophy, Riot Games will use social network analysis to map out how player behavior spreads in League of Legends and what we can learn from player interactions to make the Internet a better place. We'll discuss how Riot leverages machine learning to "learn" at massive scale what players believe is OK or not OK in the community and deliver feedback to players, and how these cutting-edge techniques can be applied to curate any online community.

## Multithreading the Entire Destiny Engine

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022164/Multithreading-the-Entire-Destiny
**desc**: Modern console architectures have heterogeneous, multi-core computation architectures differing vastly in performance and memory characteristics. As a result, game engines' multithreading architectures have moved away from system-level thread parallelism to fine-grained task and data parallelism to optimally take advantage of all available resources. Bungie's new game Destiny is a fast-paced shared-world shooter that demands a low-latency action gameplay experience. We have taken traditional job-based multithreading techniques to the next level, turning almost every part of our engine into a job graph, with only limited use of thread-based pre-emption. To do this, we have developed several novel techniques, such as splitting our main game loop into special strings of jobs which we call "job fibers." We will present our resource tracking system that allows rigorous validation multithreaded data lifecycles. This system verifies at runtime that all data accesses (reads, writes, creations and destructions) are valid and occur at safe times within the frame. We will show our entirely job-based frame structure, and delve into examples of both system-level pipelining and data parallelism.

**desc**: Game physics engines are used to create games like Portal, Titanfall, Smash Hit, and Diablo 3. Games would be far less compelling without the realistic physics simulation that engages the player's intuition and stimulates their motion awareness. Physics has become a staple of the modern gaming tradition as we try to re-create and re-interpret the world around us. The Physics for Programmers tutorial brings together speakers from Blizzard, Respawn, Mediocre, and Valve. Topics include numerical integration, contact manifolds, destruction, solvers, networking, and optimization. The focus is on rigid body physics and real-time simulation in games. There will be a mix of introductory topics, recent algorithms, and practical tips.

In ACU, we accomplished this by developing non-player-centric systemic events, capable of creating spontaneous gameplay opportunities for the players. This lecture looks back at the development of the system from both a game designer and a programmer's perspective, and how we overcame some of the challenges presented by systemic gameplay via concrete examples. This talk will present the initial vision for the system, our design intentions, problems we met as we iterated on the system, and the solutions we used, integration with other crowd systems, level and mission design concerns, as well as avenues of improvement.

## Precision of Emotion: A New Kind of "Fun" Approach

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022215/Precision-of-Emotion-A-New
**desc**: What is "fun"? Wait, wait, don't go! Okay: we talk about "fun" as a feeling, maybe even different types of feelings. But have we ever talked about it as a process? This session looks at "fun" within the scope of emotional psychology, expanding Raph Koster's "theory of fun" by hybridizing it with Eckman's universal emotion theory and laying it on top of Vygotsky's developmental psychology foundational theory (zone of proximal development yo, that's flow, Csikszentmihalyi said). What this means is that FUN is shorthand for a very complex psychological process by which we as humans convert STRESS into SATISFACTION through INSIGHT. These are big psychological universals that, when understood more deeply, change the way you look at your own game designs. If you liked the names in this description, these are the nerds you're looking for.

In minutes, a new area of the game with final assets is playable in engine. The rapid turnaround allowed designers to test many possible street layouts and elevations, and view final (or close to final) geometry, before involving environment artists. Once turned over, environment artists could concentrate on the buildings, instead of hand-modeling custom ground. This session explains the ground and many other systems used to create Sunset City.

**desc**: Simulation sports is a genre with a near-monopoly commercial situation and is deeply entrenched in licensed content and broadcast television emulation from a design standpoint. After nearly 15 years of working with EA Sports, in 2014 HB Studios launched its first fully independent title, The Golf Club, as part of a long-term vision to reimagine the simulation sports genre in a way that is sustainable for small developers. This talk covers the development of The Golf Club, including how we used procedural generation and user generated content to lower development costs, how we successfully implemented cross-platform sharing on consoles and PC, and how we integrated our community into our development process. We'll explore our vision for simulation sports and how design innovation and challenging established standards can allow small teams to be competitive in entrenched genres.

## Remember to Relax! Realizing Relaxed Behaviors in AAA Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022231/Remember-to-Relax-Realizing-Relaxed
**desc**: Unlike the "fast and furious" chaos of combat, maintaining an illusion of believability for NPCs in a relaxed scenario can be difficult. During more ambient moments, actions, behaviors and character interaction are generally slower, highly visible and identifiable. As such, flaws and inconsistencies stand out. Additionally, many games also require that relaxed behaviors be integrated into gameplay - having key requirements and focused outcomes. We will cover the importance of relaxed behaviors both for combatant and world-simulation NPCs. Using specific examples and experiences from the past, as well as current developments, this lecture will show which techniques worked and which didn't. We will discuss various AI and gameplay systems and behavior animation techniques used to create and realize these behaviors for individual and groups of NPCs, highlighting ways to maintain the illusion of life on a production and memory budget.

It has eleven team members in five countries, from Argentina to the Netherlands, and there's never been more than half of the company in the same room simultaneously. At the same time, Spry Fox is well known for producing successful and innovative games. In what ways does remote working both help and hinder development? Could it be suitable for you or your company? In this talk, Andrew Fray will discuss the benefits and drawbacks that being a remote company brings Spry Fox and its employees, and how the team maintains a friendly and informal atmosphere when developers are on different continents. He'll also explain what cloud-based tools Spry Fox uses, how they use them, and why they chose them.

## Rendering the World of Far Cry 4

**desc**: Rendering Kyrat, the beautiful world of Far Cry 4, inspired the development of many new graphical features to use the power of the new generation of hardware. First, the foundations were laid down by lighting and material improvements. An anisotropic BRDF was created, high-resolution directional sky occlusion was added, and the global illumination system was extended. Next, the vegetation system was rewritten from scratch, resulting in individual leaves being modelled up close to tessellated, displaced billboards in the distance, complete with physics simulation. Finally, overall image quality was improved through the use of temporal stabilization using motion vectors, SMAA and our "flip quad" super-sampling.

Sure, there's the general game design wisdom that everyone agrees on and can be found in many a game design book, but experienced game designers often have very specific rules that are personal to them, techniques that not everyone knows about or even agrees with. This fast-paced and energizing session puts five experienced game designers up on stage for 10 minutes each to share one game design "trick" that they use to make compelling gameplay. They will discuss experiences using these "tricks" on past projects in detail, helping the audience understand where the rules apply and where they may not. This session will expand your understanding of how to design games, while illuminating the unique ways some remarkable creators approach the craft of game design.

Against this tide of indifference and decay have been a wide range of approaches to saving game history. In this fast-paced presentation, the Internet Archive's software curator, Jason Scott, will energetically go over the general methods implemented for game history, and discuss the Internet Archive's headline-grabbing in-browser emulation systems, which have allowed long-dead software to be experienced immediately and dependably for research, reference, and entertainment.

**desc**: Video games have been the subject of major museum exhibitions for over a decade, including major shows at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. Many museums are beginning to add games and game material to their permanent collection. But how can developers help them to collect the crucial history around video games? How can museums and archives share not only the games themselves, but also educate the public on the processes and practices that are the past and present of game design and development? And how can game makers help curators design compelling and informative exhibits that reveal the way that games are made, and how they work on players? A panel of speakers from a wide range of fields - from game historians to curators and museum directors - will describe their work and share their thoughts, and listen to the the ideas and suggestions from game developers themselves. The end goal: discovering what can we do to contribute to the public understanding of game-making as a creative practice, as an industry, and as a craft.

The networking ecosystem that we built is unique - an intersection of our traditional peer-to-peer networking and a new cloud-based server architecture. This talk will discuss the spatial structure of Destiny's game world, each of the various networked experiences a player may be simultaneously connected to, and their overlapping responsibilities. Rules for host handoff at regional boundaries will be described, along with how we handle ungraceful host migrations and disconnections. Because untethered cooperative play is a pillar of our game, we will discuss the consequences and complexities these places on mission scripting and gameplay simulation.

With the highest production value of any social casino app to date, the experience immerses players in the fantasy of being a VIP at the world's most dazzling casino. This postmortem will reveal the complexities of developing such an ambitious project, from months of pre-production discovering what players want in "the world's most amazing casino," to dividing a complex feature set into a launch MVP and a prioritized series of post-launch releases. Postmortem #2: FlowPlay's Vegas World recently added sports betting to its social casino. Now in addition to playing poker, blackjack, bingo and slots, players can wager virtual currency on the outcomes of NFL, NBA, NCAA, NHL NASCAR and MLB sports. Hear why FlowPlay decided to take the plunge into sports, how it's going and what's next.

One of the most lavish game scores of 2013, Diablo III features music performed by a large symphony orchestra and choir and recorded at Abbey Road Studios, Windmill Lane in Europe and Segerstrom Hall in Southern California. Incorporating soloists, distinctive instruments (including the 12-string guitars that tie the music together with the original Diablo games), and broad palette of colors, the score ranges from the mysterious and brooding to the epic. The composers will discuss how they craft the music behind gameplay, utilizing orchestras, choirs and cutting-edge technology to create the game's immersive world. They will also discuss their stylistic inspirations: the symphonic idioms of 19th and 20th century orchestral music, world music influences, modern cinematic scoring and unconventional aleatoric techniques, thus elevating game scoring to new heights and revitalizing the orchestral tradition for the future.

## Spellbound: Asking Questions About Habit Forming Game Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022259/Spellbound-Asking-Questions-About-Habit
**desc**: Once upon a time, we aspired to develop games with that elusive "addictive" quality that delighted players. Now the term addiction has become an accusation labeled at apparently unscrupulous free-to-play designers who are leveraging the psychology of operant conditioning to allegedly extort money from players. Games that delight us often become habit-forming, but how as designers can we judge the balance between a game as a social good and the manipulation of an audience. There are huge opportunities if we can build a loyal fanbase of regular, invested players -- and huge (potentially legal) risks if we are considered to have overstepped the line into manipulation. In this session, Oscar explores the *available psychological evidence to understand the differences between habit and addiction, and to uncover the real risks of using manipulation in game design, and how we can use an understanding of habit-forming behavior responsibly. *With help from Berni Good, http://www.cyberpsychologist.co.uk.

## Still Gaming After All These Years

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022263/Still-Gaming-After-All-These
**desc**: According to the Entertainment Software Rating Board, 26% of gamers are over the age of 50, and yet the 2014 IGDA Developer Satisfaction Survey finds that only 1% of game developers are aged 50 and above. In fact, many veteran game developers report that they want to continue to make games but have found job opportunities limited upon reaching the age of 50 and above. Is this due to ageism in game industry hiring practices? This panel, comprised of a veteran game industry executive, game producer, human resources manager, executive recruiter, and developer of games for seniors will present their own experiences as over-50 gaming professionals, examine the myth versus the reality of the contributions of over-50 workers, and provide advice for those over 50 about keeping their skills current and finding opportunities to apply them.

Resilience is the ability to bounce back from difficult situations, like a material deforming under pressure and then finding back to its old shape, a person experiencing trauma and recovering from it, or an organization adapting smartly when hit by disruptive events.Our industry asks a lot of us as individuals. We constantly need to change and grow, since the world around us turns so fast. We face a lot of insecurity, change jobs, change locations, work across time zones, and we still love the product we make! All this can be inspiring, but also very exhausting. Johanna will share examples for crisis situations from her studio history, and analyze what role resilient traits played in overcoming them.

However, such questions often come up in the game designers' mind: which factors are key to the design of MMORPGs? In the long-term, how can PC online games be run in China? This speech will start from a very thorough inspection of the typical Chinese players, and introduce the mechanism for guiding the players' behavior and emotion. According to the law of the circulation of benefits, proper currency rules are made to let different kind of players take what they need, and find the suitable ways to play and achieve in their own way. Moreover, benign development of the virtual world can be achieved by the players and the persistent efforts of the designers. Additionally, macro-economic performance indicators are observed to monitor the status of the currency system, in connection with which appropriate methods are taken to guarantee the steady growth.

## Tengami: The Art of a Folding World

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022292/Tengami-The-Art-of-a
**desc**: Tengami is an atmospheric adventure game that takes place inside an authentically folding pop-up book world. Players fold and slide parts of the world to solve puzzles and make progress. Tengami is best known for its distinctive and unique art style, but what is not readily apparent is how intrinsically art, design and technology are linked to bring Tengami's folding world to life. This talk will give an inside look at the tools we developed to create realistically folding 3D pop-ups and the process of transforming these initially rather abstract looking models into something to be remembered.

## The Gamer's Brain: How Neuroscience and UX Can Impact Design

Some designers might think that this knowledge is not easy to apply, or even fear that it will distort the experience they intend to offer. However, UX and neuroscience combined are at the service of design, and can provide very concrete and easy-to-use tips to anticipate and solve design problems, sometimes even before the play testing phase. The real challenge today is to figure out how the player will likely perceive the game. By having a general understanding of how the brain works and by following UX guidelines, the designers increase the chance of their audience experiencing the intended design. This talk will provide (sometimes fun!) brain facts and UX tips illustrated by examples from various titles.

## The Importance of Cultural Touchstones in Game Design Practice

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022311/The-Importance-of-Cultural-Touchstones
**desc**: Like all creative professionals, game developers pull ideas from the world around them. Video games and other cultural content like films, comics, music, art, books and analog life experiences are all used as reference points for conceptualizing ideas and communicating them to dev teams. These "cultural touchstones" become a crucial part of everyday game studio practice, impacting everything from production efficiency to the studio's local culture and values. The potential impact of cultural touchstones on game design will be explored through a case study based on two years of ethnographic research with Red 5 Studios, Inc. during the production of Firefall. We will discuss how cultural touchstones can shape design vocabulary, influence how effectively a team communicates, and provide a basis for a whole studio's socialization. We will also look at how curating a team's cultural touchstones can maximize the benefits of a diverse team and contribute to mindful design.

However, while this way of thinking about games yields useful insights into many types of games, it breaks down when it is applied to low-interaction play spaces like Dear Esther and Gone Home. Some have even gone so far as to claim that such experiences are not games at all. This talk offers a new methodology for the design and analysis of non-interactive play spaces. It lays out six heuristics for good experiential design, and illustrates how they work by using them to analyze three successful low-interaction experiences: the airport escape in Thirty Flights of Loving, the blizzard sequence in Journey, and P.T., the playable demo for the upcoming Silent Hills.

**desc**: There's a pervasive belief in the industry that game design is a craft which has been more-or-less linearly refined and improved upon for the last 30 years. The industry has come to form so deeply around its accepted norms that any games which might work outside of those norms are heavily marginalized or seen as "bad design." This works greatly to marginalize designers who trying to challenge the medium and use their games as tools to express more personal and/or critical ideas. We'll discuss why these abstract, strange and "unprofessional" approaches to design and aesthetics are actually a secret strength of the medium that should be embraced as powerful and progressive communicative tools. We'll also examine why they are, in fact, far more powerful artistic tools than literal representation, or already deeply-entrenched approaches in the game industry and game culture.

This can be something that is apparent to the player, something that is only visible to the other devs around us, or might be something that only lives under the hood -- known only to us. The common thread is that it something that makes us ask, "why doesn't everyone do this?"

During the early phases of development we spent time standardizing this environment art workflow and boosting its efficiency with a UV mapping script for quick and precise UV layout and a special shader for the unique texture style and added variation. This session will explain each step of these environment art techniques and support it with example images and video from the production.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Mobile Games (Presented by Pollen VC)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022325/The-Uncomfortable-Truth-About-Mobile
**desc**: In the past year, the iOS App Store and Google Play have become increasingly competitive marketplaces. Over 1600+ new titles are added every day: while the top charts are monopolised by the mainstream games from giants like Supercell, Machine Zone and DeNa - thousands of independent games languish in obscurity. At the same time, games investment has dropped 25% since 2012, leaving many Indie developers with a funding shortfall. In such a cold climate, how do you fund development and user acquisition for your games? This panel, moderated by Digi-Capital's Tim Merel will be a discussion of sources of investment & funding for mobile games with insights from industry professionals at Scopely, Grow Mobile and The Tap Lab.

## The Vertical Slice Challenge

**desc**: This talk will discuss the concept of the vertical slice: what is it, what goals it's intended to achieve for the team, and whether or not it's worth the effort it takes to do it right. Volition has come to view the vertical slice (or proof of concept, or minimum viable product) as a tool that should be used to determine whether or not the team is ready to move from pre-production into production. This gate needs to satisfy both internal and external goals, and ultimately demonstrates whether or not the team understands what it is they are making and how to make it. This talk will examine where Volition has failed and succeed at making a vertical slice for our past projects, and demonstrate where we have changed our approaches and processes today to improve at planning for and executing on this major deliverable.

## There Be Monsters: Harnessing the Power of Community-Informed Development for The Long Dark

**desc**: Community has never played such a significant role in determining the success or failure of game studios and projects. Through tools like Kickstarter and Steam Early Access, developers can gather critical feedback and life-saving financial resources as they continue to refine their games. Pick-up on YouTube and Twitch can make the difference between yet another game that goes unnoticed, and the next big hit. However, involving the community in the development, and funding, of your game project is not without its risks. How do you hold on to a clear vision while also being open to feedback? How do you balance responding to community requests and being firm enough to avoid having the game change around the whims of a vocal minority? How do you deal with the "entitlement culture" that sometimes arises out of this development approach? How do you encourage positive engagement and diffuse the negativity that can spread like a cancer through a community? Industry veteran Raphael van Lierop will share some of his experiences heading up Hinterland Studio and leading the development of their acclaimed debut eEarly Access survival experience, The Long Dark.

## Thinking About People: Designing Games for Social Simulation

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1022334/Thinking-About-People-Designing-Games
**desc**: Social simulation is a powerful yet underappreciated game design tool. Although other aspects of game simulation have grown vastly more sophisticated over the years, the ability for NPCs to interact dynamically with both the player and each other has remained limited. This talk covers a wide-ranging retrospective of social simulation in games, and explores how and if such interactions may be furthered. What is it that has impeded the expansion of social simulation mechanics? Is it the attitudes of players or developers? Also, what can social simulation offer your game? By offering answers and insights, this talk inspires deeper thought about exploring personal relationships through game systems.

This presentation will discuss why this is happening, as well as the potential risks if we don't evolve our tools development process. Attendees will also learn a handful of user-centered design techniques, and how they can be used to create a shared vision to improve our tools.

Destiny is a large scope game, requiring many assets to be rigged and animated including characters, players, combatants, cinematics, vehicles, weapons, and props. The process of rigging can sometimes be a bottleneck in game productions where 3D art and animation become interdependent. We will describe how we have developed a Python codebase and toolset for Autodesk Maya utilizing object-oriented programming in Pymel. We will show how our techniques helped alleviate rigging production bottlenecks and supported iterative processes with constant changes during game development. We will share examples of animation and rigging problems that arose during the production of Destiny and how we solved them using various methods.

**desc**: Umbra's automatically created spatial database can be used to not only perform occlusion culling but also to solve other problems such as 3D path finding, shadow caster culling and audio propagation. In this talk, Remedy's engineers will expand on how the Umbra middleware is used in the upcoming Xbox One exclusive Quantum Break from Remedy Entertainment. Quantum Break presents a major challenge for a visibility system with dynamic content that runs the gamut from indoors to large dynamically changing outdoor environments. Remedy also utilizes Umbra for shadow rendering optimization and makes use of the Umbra spatial database for audio occlusion.The talk will contain several real-world examples of how Umbra is used in Remedy's engine, performance, toolchain integration and pros and cons of using an out-of-house solution.Umbra is a visibility middleware used in games such as Destiny, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Rime.

**desc**: Watch_Dogs aimed to set the bar for what a Next Gen experience should be and we learned a lot trying to achieve this goal from an audio and musical perspective. Taking on this project was a great opportunity for our team as we got to define a musical palette for Ubisoft's newest open world franchise. However, balancing all the musical ingredients of such a big game, and trying to meet new, next-gen expectations proved both fun and headache-inducing.This session will explain in detail what we set out to achieve with music for Watch_Dogs. Covering direction, licensing, scoring, integration and system designs, we'll discuss the specific choices we made over the course of the production and how we tried to keep the musical design coherent while supporting a serious narrative in an often chaotic open world game.

**desc**: From compelling, new puzzle mechanics to rich narrative worlds, from elegant meta-games to startling graphical styles, from robust characters in episodic delivery to empathy-oriented story settings, the world of pay-to-play mobile and online games is alive with innovations. Though traditionally seen as less lucrative than free-to-play games, these innovative pockets in pay-to-play games offer game designers and producers a glimpse into where they might take the F2P category in the coming months and years. In this talk, veteran creative directors Kenny Shea Dinkin (Diner Dash, ClueFinders, Carmen Sandiego, Dream Chronicles) and Ray Holmes (Farmville, League of War, Alpha Protocol, Bloodrayne 2) explore the more innovative niches of today's mobile and online pay-to-play design landscape, shedding light onto what free-to-play game designers might want to take with them as they explore and grow the other end of the marketplace.

It's now evolved into portals of creativity, where people of all skill levels can have fun making music that express their individuality. Designing expressive, interactive music for the masses, however, poses a down-to-earth challenge for engineers -- how do they give players ample opportunity to be expressive (as actual instruments do) while providing the "musical training wheels" that help make music novices sound good, no matter how they choose to play (as games do). This presentation, moderated by game audio pioneer Brian Schmidt, will discuss specific case studies from Harmonix's "Fantasia," Ubisoft's "Rocksmith 2" and Smule's "Magic Piano" and "Sing! Karaoke" -- describing in detail how each attempted to balance those two seemingly competing goals, the tradeoffs and the insights gleaned from each example.

**desc**: Players make purchase decisions based upon marketing trailers, PR stories and E3 demos, but up until now there have been very few dependable ways to measure which factors exactly drive those choices.This lecture will help developers understand the reliable and measurable psychological principals that motivate players' purchase decisions. It will present never-before-seen research and will extend the "player experience of need satisfaction" (PENS) framework and its practical application of key constructs in the gaming space (i.e. competence, autonomy, and relatedness) to an area never before discussed: Understanding the optimal communication of need satisfaction within the marketing and PR communications that are so critical to ensuring sales and success. This talk will integrate several new research projects (including research on key console launches in 2014) alongside metrics that validate the predictive value of the "anticipated need satisfaction" approach.

This sounds like an old-school way of promotion, but far too many indies are depending too much on the dream "going viral" or of an instant smash hit. In this session Charles Cox, CEO of 4gency, references statistics and personal experience to demonstrate why indies need to expand their promotion efforts for their own products and offers up solutions and advice on how to realize the "indie dream."

The panel will address a core question: is there any difference between the way a man and a woman composes music? What are the pros and cons of versatility (writing powerful music in many conventional idioms) versus having a unique, distinctive voice? Why is it important for women in the game industry to support each other? How can men help? How can women and men balance issues of work and family? How can women convince decision makers to trust them with big budgets and high stakes? We will examine the challenges of cultivating a career, the required skill sets, and the success stories, along with the political and business savvy needed for a progressive career path. The panelists will also discuss patterns of cultivating careers as a game composer, what has worked for women in other creative tracks (development, design and programming), opportunities for professional growth, navigating the minefields on a high-stakes job, overcoming career stagnation, and branding/re-branding.

**desc**: Dragon Age: Inquisition required BioWare to re-think their approach to creating story content.Knowing that the Inquisition would visit more than one cave, the challenge was to populate BioWare's largest 'open world' with only a handful of designers.To achieve the desired content scope and density, the team split and experimented with two opposing techniques. The first group aimed to create discrete narrative content, while the second planned to implement standalone systems. The former found their content scaled poorly, and the latter discovered their content had a disconnected impact. A truce was reached when it was suggested that the solution for DA:I was somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.
