## 'Blaseball': Game Development as Performance

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027566/-Blaseball-Game-Development-as
**desc**: Blaseball is the wild, wacky, horrific baseball sim that probably took over your twitter at least once last year. It's also a game pushing the bounds of interactive narrative, by combining systemic story telling, emergent narrative, mass fan participation and performative game development to create a TTRPG-like massively multiplayer experience. This talk outlines the key principles and learnings that allow Blaseball to continue to function, explores some of the challenges and failures to be overcome, and provides case studies Blaseball's most successful moments -- the times when the Developers, Fans, and Simulation worked together to create deeply meaningful payoffs.

## 'Knockout City's' Parallel, Deterministic, and Rewindable Entity System

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027634/-Knockout-City-s-Parallel
**desc**: We present a general-purpose game entity system that supports deterministic, parallel computation and the ability to rewind world state within a time window. Such a system can be used to support robust client-side prediction in a networked game, world state scrubbing at development time, and effective utilization of processing power on multi-core hardware. We discuss how the entity system, working together with our scripting language, ensures concurrent, deterministic, and efficient data flow, in a way that is largely transparent to users of the system. We show how this system was used on "Knockout City", an online multiplayer action game with dodgeball mechanics, to author everything from core gameplay to user interface and player progression.

## Advanced Graphics Summit: Kickstart RT: Easy Open Source Ray Tracing

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027921/Advanced-Graphics-Summit-Kickstart-RT
**desc**: Ray tracing is becoming quite prevalent in AAA games. However, to make use of this new technology a game engine must generally create a BVH of all scene geometry and bind all materials active in the scene. This requirement is often at odds with the dynamic nature of scene composition and material systems. Kickstart RT presents a novel cross-API (Direct3D11, Direct3D12 & Vulkan), cross-platform (win64 & ARM) solution that caches direct lighting information into a world space structure that is then used to ray trace reflections, GI and shadows. In this talk, we'll deep dive into the mechanisms and the algorithm used in Kickstart RT, and show off the quality and performancecompared to traditional ray tracing and reference path tracing. The aim of this technology is to enable many developers to add ray tracing effects to their game engine in a much shorter timespan than it might otherwise take and to bring ray tracing to developers still using Direct3D11.

## Adventures with Deferred Texturing in 'Horizon Forbidden West'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027553/Adventures-with-Deferred-Texturing-in
**desc**: To accelerate its foliage and alpha tested geometry Horizon Forbidden West implements a novel loosely tiled deferred texturing system. A visibility buffer is drawn as a pre-pass followed by analysis and shading steps which run entirely in compute shaders. The use of compute shaders also provides extra flexibility that allows for the implementation of a software variable rate shading solution. Due to being able to run on the compute pipes on PS4 and PS5 it is able to overlap both the G-Buffer rendering and the rendering of cascaded shadow maps meaning that analysis and shading typically have very little overhead. This presentation will describe details of the system, and the optimizations and design choices made to integrate it into the Decima engine.

## Ahistorical Accuracy: Bringing New Myths and Representation to 'Civilization'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027555/Ahistorical-Accuracy-Bringing-New-Myths
**desc**: For thirty years, the Civilization series has mixed historical accuracy with ahistorical fantasy. Players have delighted equally in recreating the Roman Empire and in sending Aztecs to the moon. A huge strength of procedural games is offering players intriguing narrative puzzle pieces, and letting them put those pieces together in their own unique way. It takes restraint on the designer's part to stop short of telling the player's story on their behalf.nnBut what happens when designers add actual fantastical elements to the game, like mythical heroes and secret societies with almost magical powers? More broadly, how can they include characters and myths from cultures that are historically underrepresented? What repercussions does this have for cultural representation, fan expectation, and the fictional grounding of the game?nnCome learn how the Civilization design team tackled these challenges amidst a transition to live ops.

Age of Empires IV, the latest instalment in the long running RTS franchise, is a very AI intensive game and an obvious candidate for ML application. We will cover some of the ML techniques, including Reinforcement Learning, used in AoE IV but with specific focus on what worked, and why some didn't. We'll also cover some of the ongoing research and early results. We'll cover training techniques, how to choose between the vast array of ML tools, and what we did to optimize the (runtime) inference. We highlight the technical challenges involved in integrating cutting edge RL research into a modern AAA game. This talk will be a joint presentation between Microsoft ML researchers and the AI developers that worked on AoE IV.

**desc**: Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is a single player narrative experience where the player takes control of Star-Lord, the so-called leader of the Guardian's of the Galaxy. One of the core pillars of the project is that we should sell to the player the fantasy of actually "hanging out with the Guardians". In order to achieve that, AI companions should feel alive and capable of engaging in convincing interactions with the player. By having four AI companions, and a great variety of enemy archetypes during combat, we had to learn to embrace its chaotic nature and really push the limit of our AI and gameplay systems. On this presentation, we will focus on an overview of some core AI systems, such as, combat behavior tree, threat management, range and melee combat systems, brawling motion matching, combat acting and contextual barks, their evolution throughout production and some of the lessons we learned along the way.

**desc**: If you've played with Dungeon AI or LitRPG Adventures, you've seen the power of language models like GPT-3 and LaMDA in action. However, while large language models can generate story and dialogue that makes sense, their coherence often only lasts for a few hundred words before they lose the thread of what they're talking about, making it difficult to use them out of the box for goal-oriented experiences like games. In this talk, we demonstrate how to use LLMs in a graph-based authorship tool inspired by Twine to create narrative games populated with coherent and immersive NPCs that use dialogue unique to each playthrough and tailored to the player's input. We will walk through the creation of a graph, demo playthrough of the resulting narrative game, and equip the audience with tools to build next generation narrative games using off the shelf language models.

**desc**: Utility AI has a reputation of being difficult to control compared to alternatives like behavior trees or FSMs. Designing and tuning utility architectures is sometimes perceived as more of an art than a science. What does the value of a utility score really mean? What concrete effect does changing a utility score have? How many "apples" is an orange worth?nnIntuitively, it would make sense to provide utility with a standard unit of measurement. This idea has struggled in the real world, since it is difficult to imagine how one might "measure" happiness. However, it is plausible in a game environment, where designers have perfect information.nnIn this session, a new "unit utility" AI is proposed. This approach challenges incumbent methods and is informed by concepts in statistics, probability theory, and reinforcement learning.

In this talk, Simon Habib, Lead Technical Animator at Eidos Montreal, presents the innovations that were implemented to accomplish this.nnFrom simultaneously capturing the actors' performances on an in-house mocap stage to delivering final polished facial animations, their pipeline offers quantity without sacrificing quality. Batch processing with Faceware allows them to generate hours of facial animations for both in-game dialogue and cinematics. Furthermore, scanning real-life models in their photogrammetry room ensures that the characters' expressions remain believable and anatomically correct.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027979/Art-Direction-Summit-Costume-Body
**desc**: Character designers and costume designers have the same job: both concentrate on expressing the character's personality, status and background and the production-specific features such as era, climate, and environmental conditions through character's appearance. Since highly realistic depictions of reality are achievable with the current technology, the traditional skills of costume design can prove useful in developing a realistic game character. This talk will help you think like a costume designer: to acknowledge and employ the narrative potential of clothing and improve the realism level of wearable assets by keeping in mind the material behaviour on a human body, clothing construction, and fit. In addition, this talk will define the difference between fashion and costume design in game context and points out the importance of choosing the right approach for your production.

## Art Practice in 'Justice Online': Whisper Between Dances and Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028077/Art-Practice-in-Justice-Online
**desc**: Dance is one of the oldest art forms of mankind. The interpretation of dance moves not only shows the dancer's emotional expression, but also contains profound cultural connotations. In the market, the use of dance in games is mainly focused on dance games, but in fact, the significance of dance to games is much deeper and broader. "Justice Online" is a high quality MMORPG developed by NetEase Games Thunder Fire with a background in the Northern Song Dynasty. The action designer shows the accumulation of dance culture in the Northern Song Dynasty by restoring the real dance movements in the game.Because the background era of the game belongs to the Northern Song Dynasty, the action designers chose Chinese classical dance. Classical dance is a representative dance in traditional Chinese art, which can be traced back to ancient Chinese court dances. It is a dance that combines strength and softness, and its interpretation has a certain degree of difficulty. If it is produced purely through animation, the actual deductive effect will lack artistic expression. Therefore, we invited famous national dancers to choreograph the dance moves in Justice Online and use motion capture technology to simultaneously map the graceful posture of the dancers into the game. With the help of a professional choreographer team, the elegance and extravagance of the Song Dynasty are presented in a panoramic view of the dance.The uniqueness of stage art is that each scene is unique, and each scene cannot be reproduced or copied. Art is very valuable. We have been committed to dialogue with dance artists and continue and reuse their artistic creations through motion capture technology. At the same time, through the dance performance in the game, to achieve the publicity and influence of the dance art on the players. Through this lecture, you can understand how we cooperate with dancers through motion capture technology in game action design, and how to use dance actions in animation production and character action design.

Follow the journey that the four founders of id Software took to create a watershed moment in gaming history that showed the world that the PC could play a new kind of game that no other machine could replicate. Game designer, programmer, and id Software co-founder, John Romero, will take the audience through this short seven month timeline and show you just how much happened during Wolfenstein 3D's development rollercoaster ride.

Are our planning decisions always rational or are they influenced by biases all humans have? How can we recognize them and can we mitigate their influence?Cognitive biases that arise in the context of planning such as anchoring, confirmation bias, illusion of validity and more are very well known, observable and predictable. In this talk, Alexandre Moufarek presents a review on the scientific literature on cognitive biases in the context of planning with teams, concrete real-world examples of how they occur and techniques to mitigate their effects.

Here at Gamesight, we've run hundreds of successful influencer campaigns, accumulating both experience and data to back up the validity of our methods. Content creators are the lifeblood of both new game releases in 2021, heavily factoring into whether or not the game will have a successful launch and post-launch longevity. We take into account several factors when running campaigns including the cost of click/install conversions per influencer, the total number/average of those conversions, and viewership trends compared to similar games during their launches. During our presentation, we'll be using multiple examples from past campaigns we've run in order to emphasize critical points in our agenda.

## Community Validated Deployment: Why You Need to Go Earlier than Early Access

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027884/Community-Validated-Deployment-Why-You
**desc**: Developers all know they should be eating their business broccoli, do market research, be active on social media, and build up an engaged community in order to have a chance at success. However, with limited resources and a typical focus on actual game development, it is often hard to execute the marketing and business side effectively. This session will lay out a community validated deployment framework to connect the game making process with the need to build marketing momentum leading up to launch. This is all the stuff that needs to get done BEFORE you get into Early Access (eg, running private betas). The goal is to move beyond market/competitive analysis oriented estimates, and instead leverage community building to both assist in game product iteration and market fit. This approach brings your social media and community efforts in alignment with a clear call to action and lays the foundation for launching successfully. Bonus: you'll also have a more compelling case when pitching publishers, platforms, and investors.

Instead, many of our student project teams are plagued by so many communication and team dynamics issues that projects stall and some students even grow to dread any type of teamwork. In my undergraduate programming classes and graduate game development process class, I've adopted three strategies to help students proactively build healthy, inclusive environments where they can all contribute to the best of their ability. As a result, I've seen students build better games with less stress and uncertainty - even when working 100% remotely. While the depth and details vary for undergraduate vs. graduate teams, the overall approach is the same and can be applied to any team-based course element.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027880/Fear-of-Scope-The-1
**desc**: Whenever we look at how much we still need to deliver, it makes us anxious. Scope seems to be the source of all our trouble when we make games. The further we are in development, the larger the scope becomes. It takes us forever to introduce the necessary cuts and in the meantime, we keep asking ourselves "how are we going to deliver all of this on time?"That is a wrong question and a wrong attitude. We fear the scope because we believe it is real. We fear the scope because we think it's the monster we need to slay. We fear the scope because we often don't have proven methods to revise it before it becomes unwieldy. It just so happens I've designed such a method.

It also covers how this high-level concept was turned into a toolset for designers and how that toolset was used to drive the look, feel, and direction of the entire interactive experience.

**desc**: There are many game design topics that don't require an hour to discuss, but can be useful, especially for experienced game designers, as quick deep dives or punchy bits of food for thought. The Game Designer's Notebook asks seasoned game designers to open up a few pages from their notebook, and share insights and explorations into contemporary design issues in the F2P game design arena. Part microtalk, part design review, the GDN is the session at the GDC F2P Summit where game designers get to jump in, go deep and jump out. This year's session will offer: Toiya Kristen Finley - Schnoodle Media, LLCA simple way to define narrative design is to say that it delivers story using any aspect of a game, from the worldbuilding and dialogue to the UI and camera angles. All members of a team can contribute to a game's narrative design, including individuals who don't consider themselves to be storytellers. Discussions on great narrative design tend to be limited to console and PC games, but mobile developers are using clever concepts to mature storytelling in this space. This micro talk explores various ways to implement narrative design into story-heavy and non-story-oriented mobile games, and how all members of the team can be encouraged to take ownership of their project's narrative design.Christopher Foster - Hidden DoorAdvances in Machine learning have the potential to invent new kinds of games and experiences. One particularly exciting opportunity is in using natural language generative technology to enable a new type of narrative play: the co-creation of improvised stories. These opportunities require a shift in approach towards probabilistic design, where the potential for emergent delight comes with issues of editorial control and safety. These novel experiences also have the potential to enable new economic models for content. This microtalk presents early findings and helpful perspectives for exploring this gaming frontier.Michelle Woods - Haiku GamesAs game makers, we all strive to create moments of joy for our players, like rolling a Yahtzee, defeating a boss, or plunking a Tetris piece into place. It can be tricky to get these moments right. Simple design flaws can get in the way, deflating the moment, or missing it completely. It can be especially tricky in games that rely strictly on skill or brainpower rather than chance, as they're more prone to causing frustration, making players feel stuck. This microtalk aims to identify a few key elements that amplify the joy, and common design pitfalls to avoid.

Now, the advisory board of the Free-to-Play Summit is proud to revive this GDC tradition, with a free-to-play focused version of the Challenge. Four free-to-play designers will have been given marching orders, and tasked with designing a game around that given problem. All four will present their idea to the Summit audience, followed by an audience vote. Innovative thinking and lively presentations are in store for all attendees!The theme of this year's Challenge is "Designing for Minnows". Free-to-play games are almost always tuned to extract most of their revenue from "whales" -- those super-fans of the game who spend the big bucks, while the other 99.9% of the game's players spend little or nothing on it. We've challenged three free-to-play designers to come up with a design for a game that will extract the vast majority of it's revenue not from "whales" but from "minnows"... players who, over their entire lifetime, spend $10 or less. Come see what our challengers have come up with, and then help vote for the winner!

In Everdale, every player in the valley can see what every other player is doing in real time, all the time. The player can simply zoom out of their village and zoom into another player's village to see what they are doing in real time. Players participate together in shared projects to build their valley, with joint persistent progress.

Bungie tried to evolve the original Destiny formula into a more accessible box product, and in the process quickly lost much of the trust they had built with Destiny's most engaged players.In the five years since Destiny 2 launched, Bungie has rethought and reimplemented almost every aspect of their Live business, and seen dramatic, sustained success as a result.In this talk, Justin Truman will dive into many of the changes and learnings needed to convert a studio used to building traditional AAA box products into a more authentic, modern Live service organization. This talk will take an interdisciplinary approach to discuss the process, mindset, and cultural changes required as Bungie transformed their approaches to prioritization, organization, and decision-making.

**desc**: As the extended reality (XR) industry advances, features and resources that seek to close the gap between real-life interactions and simulations are available for developers to use. One such feature is hand tracking, allowing players to interact with a virtual reality experience without needing controllers. Unlike controllers that generally use the same schema and button systems, hand tracking is not yet standardized and brings with it a number of interaction opportunities, myths, and challenges for input recognition.Developers must consider many nuances when utilizing hand tracking technology. Covered in session will be common tracking methods, examples of interaction models (including hybrid interaction models that use hands in combination with other inputs), and a number of notable assumptions that must be cast aside.

In early 2021, Niantic launched the Black Developers Initiative (BDI) to identify and support Black led developers and game teams to increase representation. This is one program focused on helping more Black developers have opportunities to build and showcase their work, but there is so much more we can and should do to ensure the people building the real-world metaverse are more representative of the people who live in the real-world metaverse. But Niantic cannot do this work alone, not even close. We need the entire industry to help keep redlining and other bad practices out of the real-world metaverse.

**desc**: The popular term "kindness coins" describes the transactional nature of many romantic or sexual relationships in games: do enough "nice things" for an NPC until they "reward" the PC with love or sex. But what if there was an approach that allowed for more narrative flexibility, more opportunity for player role play, more agency and character development for NPCs, and most importantly, more meaningful or erotic relationship arcs? What if core loops and narrative arcs weren't based on generic "kindness" or "flirts" but on character-specific chemistry? What if romance and attraction can be triggered in EVERY game system, not just dialogue? And to make it really spicy, how can writers and designers incorporate a little romantic random chance into the mix? This talk will explore these questions and more while presenting two useful new models for moving beyond kindness coins: the chemistry card tower, and the chemistry casino.

## Game Narrative Summit: Kindness Coins, or Chemistry Casino? A New Take On Romantic/Sexual Narrative Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027962/Game-Narrative-Summit-Kindness-Coins
**desc**: The popular term "kindness coins" describes the transactional nature of many romantic or sexual relationships in games: do enough "nice things" for an NPC until they "reward" the PC with love or sex. But what if there was an approach that allowed for more narrative flexibility, more opportunity for player role play, more agency and character development for NPCs, and most importantly, more meaningful or erotic relationship arcs? What if core loops and narrative arcs weren't based on generic "kindness" or "flirts" but on character-specific chemistry? What if romance and attraction can be triggered in EVERY game system, not just dialogue? And to make it really spicy, how can writers and designers incorporate a little romantic random chance into the mix? This talk will explore these questions and more while presenting two useful new models for moving beyond kindness coins: the chemistry card tower, and the chemistry casino.

## Game Narrative Summit: Let Players Break Your Story: Narrative Design in Immersive Sims

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027952/Game-Narrative-Summit-Let-Players
**desc**: How do you tell a compelling story when all the most important characters can be killed? In this session, narrative designer Lucas Loredo breaks down how to construct narratives in games where players are given the ultimate freedom: to break the story. He'll explore the best practices developed at WolfEye Studios for their immersive sim Weird West, from modular storytelling to effective branching, from writing stories that support rule-breaking players to old-fashioned plot failsafes. Then, the conversation will open up to address what makes for good storytelling in games in general, why so many games aren't leveraging the medium's best tools, and what sort of design philosophy will finally help us cut the umbilical from television and film once and for all.

## Game Narrative Summit: Leveraging Player Psychology in 'Bluebeard's Bride'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027956/Game-Narrative-Summit-Leveraging-Player
**desc**: The IndieCade Grand Jury Award winning game Bluebeard's Bride is a lean and heavy-hitting tabletop role-playing game that entices players into engaging in very scary experiences. Rooted in feminine horror, the game has been described as sometimes cathartic, but always "utterly terrifying" in a way that players still find fun. In this session you will learn how the application of the principles of Jungian Depth Psychology helped create an interactive environment in which players were willing to disclose and play with their worst fears, and how these principles can be applied in your design to draw players into meaningful emotional experiences, whether the genre is horror or slice-of-life.

In this session, Tony Howard-Arias (Game Designer and Co-writer of Scarlet Hollow) goes in-depth on how they and their partner tackled (and continue to tackle) these challenges on both a micro and macro level. On the macro level, they'll discuss how Scarlet Hollow is intentionally written to build towards a number of discrete endings whose thematic relevance is a reflection of how players have chosen to interact with their narrative. And on the micro level, they'll talk about their game's complex relationship-system, and how minor changes in dialogue and art can make a given playthrough feel personalized and uniquely tailored to its player.

Knowledge on tourist psychology, sociology, and anthropology can be used to create deeper, more authentic gaming experiences. Marcin Makaj, an indie game developer, academic lecturer, and a scientist explores the works of most important researchers of tourist behavior, authenticity of tourist experiences, and perceptions of reality (inc. D.J. Boorstin, J. Baudrillard, U. Eco, D. MacCannell, E. Cohen, and J. Urry). In the next parts, he presents how those theories translate to video game design, providing good and bad examples from existing games. Finally, Makaj gives a step-by-step guide of best practices and their utilization in any game design process.

But what about these two worlds that are so different brings them together: one tracing back to multiple millennium bygone religious rituals, and one that technically emerged in the 20th century in a MIT Lab? Forged together by their common enterprise of enlisting active empathy within their audience or player, video games and theatre serve as the two most powerful devices for bringing up visceral emotion in those who encounter it. One by the conduit of performance and another by the use of modern technology, the end goal can be the same. This talk will cover the practice of dramaturgy for video games, player empathy within design, and what we as game creators can borrow from the oldest art form around.

It's an introspection about how the pandemic allowed the industry to reexamine how things are donefiguring out what's important (and perhaps what's not), and how things can be better moving forward. Topics include: finding the right balance in a remote/hybrid work environment, taking a stronger approach to addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, and empowering developers to "kill it with kindness."Part 1: Reimagining Eidos-Montral: Shifting Our Organizational Structure by David Anfossi (Head of Studio, Eidos-Montral) The pandemic pushed video game studio Eidos-Montral to rethink their balance between well-being and efficiency in a remote/hybrid work environment. They worked to adapt their organizational structure, exploring ways to do things differently and engaging their staff in between ways. Sometimes, the results were great; other times, they had to go back to the drawing board. In this Main Stage session, head of studio David Anfossi will be sharing some of Eidos-Montral's findings during this transition.Part 2: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging: Sony Interactive Entertainment's Journey to Improve DE&I During the Pandemic and Beyond by Davina Mackey (Director, PlayStation Studios QA & President, Black@PlayStation)Since the start of the pandemic, there have been racial and gender-based current events that have impacted organizations across the globe, including the video game industry. Some organizations made a conscious decision to remain silent. Others responded with commitments to support social justice initiatives and advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). In this session, Director of Support Services and Operations & Black@PlayStation Employee Network President Davina Mackey will share what initiatives Sony Interactive Entertainment chose to take a stance against racial injustice and increase its efforts to support DE&I.Part 3: Killing it with Kindness and Intention ...Devolver and Beyond by Mike Wilson (Founding Partner, Devolver Digital) Devolver Digital started as a scrappy, punk rock group of five industry veterans and outlaws with a mission to elevate indie gameswithout compromising artistic or business integrity. In this session, co-founder Mike Wilson reflects on what he considers the keys to the small team's successful run over the past 12 years, and where he plans to take those hard-learned lessons into the future: Through purpose, intention, and integrity, all of which is grounded in basic kindness.

In this talk, Deck Nine Game's Zak Garriss and Jon Zimmerman explore the evolution of empathy as a fundamental mechanic of narrative adventure games and why they chose to render this mechanic explicit in the design of Alex's empathy power in Life is Strange: True Colors. They share their history with the mechanic's design and the strengths - and challenges - it brought to the writing of Alex's story. Drawing from recent literature on the power of empathy in social relationships--writings that informed their work in the writers' room--they zoom out to consider the role of the artist in fostering human connection and tolerance.

Stonefly's Technical Game Designer, Mel Ramsden will discuss how the team approached these challenges using theme and setting to drive the decisions behind the systemic design of the combat, how these constraints led them to making a microscale mech game where you engage in king of the hill style arena battles, and how they designed a variety of non-lethal wind-based abilities the player could utilize in these battles to combat bugs - creating a gameplay loop that felt exciting, challenging but ultimately, non-violent.

Wildermyth uses a host of techniques to encourage emotional investment in procedurally generated characters, and we've worked hard to avoid moments that push players away from that connection. nnIn this talk, Nate will go over how each aspect of the game bends towards this one goal, of creating memorable, relatable, even iconic heroes, and encouraging the player to love them. We'll cover specific techniques used, including how our procedural narrative system works. Almost equally important is avoiding the pitfalls, such as breach of trust, acting out of character, or rage quits, and we'll cover examples of how we overcame each of these.

Publishers can provide much needed funding, production and marketing support, as well as providing access to a community of players for your game. However, any publishing agreement is by default likely to weigh in the publisher's favour. Following on from Contract Killers: Episode1 (2021) I will continue to look at those provisions that can sometimes be used by publishers to negatively impact a developer, explain in-depth about what certain clauses actually mean in practice, and hopefully give you some confidence heading into a negotiation that it is ok to ask for certain clauses to be changed before you sign on the dotted line.

Showing a variety of implementations from his own games, award-winning game designer Chris Totten shows how to use public domain content for building unique visual and audio identities, making games from recognizable IP, or even promoting your game to new audiences. Through topics such as how to find public domain content, how to confirm a work's copyright and trademark status, how to use and cite this content, and recommendations for best honoring the original work. By doing so, this talk provides a clear roadmap on how to maximize the use of these useful and freely available resources in your games.

The style we developed was achieved not by some grand vision, but by a series of parameters and considerations developed to fit the needs of the rest of the project.

This year, Adrn Novell (Electronic Arts) will discuss how refusing to give up on their game, SkyRider, nearly broke him. Ido Yehieli ( Stellar Cartography Interactive UG) will share the challenges of adapting game jam ideas and principles to full-time development. Keith Burgun (Dinofarm Games) reflects on how many years to come to terms with the fact that 'these genres might just not fit that well together'. Finally, Dave Proctor (Mighty Yell Studios) will offer us a new lens to view 'success' and 'failure' beyond just sales numbers.I Had to Abandon My Game After 4 Years And It Nearly Broke MeAdrn Novell, (Game Designer, Electronic Arts)Shared knowledge and experiences after 4+ years of developing an indie game, tried everything to make it work and still failed. How being naive, South American and young game developer lead us to make a mistake after the other.Not Every Busker Can Play at the Orchestra Ido Yehieli, (CEO, Stellar Cartography Interactive UG)In 2012 I took part of "indie buskers" - a group of indies taking ideas from the audience and live streaming a game jam over a weekend (for "pay as you wish" support from people viewing the stream). The resulting game of that jam was very popular, raised a bunch of money from viewers & I decided "if I made *that* in a weekend I'll bet I can make something really amazing from it in a few months!".The talk is about why that didn't happen, and at the end of 3 months I ended up with a game barely any different than the original weekend jam game. It sold very little of mobile, I couldn't get a flash sponsorship for the web version. It didn't recoup even the modest amount of money I invested into extending it these few months (a lot less than the original buskers version did).Escape the Omnochronom!Keith Burgun, (Game Designer, Keith Burgun Games)In 2018, a strange and mysterious game appeared on Steam: Escape the Omnochronom! A weird turn-based combination of rogue-likes and MOBAs, with a dark, bizarre setting. The story behind the highly experimental game -- and why it did not work -- is an interesting one that includes a number of important lessons, particularly for solo indie devs like Escape the Omnochronom's creator, Keith Burgun. What was it that made this game not work? When do you decide to pull the plug on an idea, particularly in the world of strategy games where things are often not fun until a game comes together?The Real Failures Were Plans We Made Along The WayDave Proctor, (Director, Mighty Yell Studios)If you can believe it, sometimes a game isn't an earth-shattering global number one hit on day one. We can plan and project and prognosticate our desired outcome, but as the landscape of how we sell games changes, so too must our expectations. Dave Proctor was game director on The Big Con, and while the game is far from a failure, he wants to talk about everything that went wrong. Also, as it becomes harder and harder to understand the randomness of the market, how do we define what real failure is and what lessons we can really learn from it?

**desc**: Narrative designer and writer Emma Kidwell shares how developers can integrate heavy experiences from their personal lives into games (through dialogue, prose, or dispersed in quests) without sacrificing their health or well-being. In this lecture, Kidwell will analyze titles that contain heavier content while also giving a short post-mortem of "I Wish I Were A Robot", an intimate game about someone living with depression and intrusive thoughts. Kidwell gives best practices for developers when moving forward with incorporating darker themes into their work, and explains why it's important for content that may need warnings to still be shared with others.

**desc**: In a changing industry landscape, games are funded by different types of investors, ranging from traditional publishers, to platform holders, to VCs, PE, and government grants, and each of these have contrasting backgrounds. Some want immediate ROI, others are focused on long-term IP building, and some are focused on marketing a new platform. This means that deal terms are more varied than ever, and often more complicated to understand.n nIn this presentation Thunderful Games Chief Strategy & Investment Officer Agostino Simonetta will detail how to best pitch these different types of investors, who are all driven by different motivations. He will outline the challenges and opportunities offered by this evolving landscape, advise studios how to focus on their strengths, and outline the various motivations and goals that drive different types of investors. Attendees will come away with a better understanding of the investment landscape and how to create better, more tailored pitches.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027867/Leaders-Working-at-the-Heart
**desc**: Project management methodologies and processes in the video game industry have been analyzed ad nauseum, often sold as production cure-alls. While these mechanics of game production are indeed important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: the emotional and elusive feel of being a great leader/producer/project manager. Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session we will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that we have encountered throughout our careers and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include: Learnings from overcoming our first major challenge while building a new team, game, studio, and culture completely remotely. What it's like to create a brand new studio and form a brand new team during a pandemic when you don't have all the answers. nHow admitting you don't know can be the most terrifying and empowering leadership change you can make.

## Machine Learning Summit: Emotional Neural Style Transfer: Expressing Character AI Emotion through Paintings

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027590/Machine-Learning-Summit-Emotional-Neural
**desc**: Recently machine learning has been applied mostly for asset creations. We take a new step on applying machine learning in game AI to transform the way a character AI expresses its emotion, which generally has been limited to facial expression, body gesture, and vocal intonation. In particular, we adopted neural style transfer that visualizes the AI's feeling. The session covers how the emotion controls the style transfer, the in-depth explanation of the style transfer model, and how it is implemented in the game. The character AI documents what it sees along its journey in the form of painting and uses style transfer to visualize its feeling to the player, allowing a new kind of player-AI interaction in the game. The character can also use style blending and region masking to focus on a particular aspect of the paintings according to its interests.

**desc**: Frame rate is a key indicator which measure the fluency of a game. Assuming that we can predict frame rate by a model, we can take measures (such as reducing the rendering quality in advance) to ensure the smooth running of a game when the frame rate is predicted to drop. This lecture will take "Conqueror's Blade", a recently released multiplayer action competitive game, as the experimental platform. Here, we will introduce how Booming Tech collects and stores relative data at the scene of game latency and how to implement a frame rate prediction model to mine those key features that affect frame rate. In this experiment, the data we collected are all general game data. In other words, you can also collect similar data in your own game and easily reproduce our model, thereby helping you iterate the strategy of game optimization.

## Machine Learning Summit: Walk Lizzie, Walk! Emergent Physics-Based Animation through Reinforcement Learning

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027982/Machine-Learning-Summit-Walk-Lizzie
**desc**: Can you animate a user-created creature in a completely physics-based, interactive fashion? How about a hundred? In this talk the speaker will present a new reinforcement learning approach to automatic animation. With the click of a button and no animators involved, the speaker will show how to give life to digital creations by allowing them to learn by themselves. Under this paradigm, animation is no longer a starting point, but an emergent property of the anatomy: the problem of locomotion becomes more akin to robotics than to classical animation. Join this journey through the problems, methods, and results towards our vision: empowering anyone to create.

## Math In Game Development Summit: Deep Dive: Quaternion Springs

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027853/Math-In-Game-Development-Summit
**desc**: It seems like a rather simple challenge: apply a spring to a quaternion so that it smoothly rotates between different orientations. However, most simple approaches will fail, creating oddly curved trajectories or failing under large forces. This is a common behavior that many games might need for targeting, animation, and physics. Why is this so challenging?nnIn this talk, we will do a deep dive into the creation of a mathematically accurate quaternion spring. We'll learn how to take the derivative of a quaternion, explore concepts such as the swing-twist decomposition, and emerge on the other side with a fully working quaternion spring implementation, fit to be dropped into any game project.nnThe math isn't all that complex, and plus, visualizing the 4th dimension is a ton of fun!

We hope that players in the game can continue to enjoy the game. As a game launched in 2018, "Meteor Butterfly Sword" is currently running the game with a team of less than half of the online period, still maintaining stable revenue and popularity, and bringing new surprises to players in each version. This time, I will share with you how our team manages and produces version content from the three aspects of "User persona + Requirement deconstruction", "Bimonthly version + Weekly unlock", and "Copy, Combine and Match". We hope that through this speech, the game team in continuous operation can be provided with practical experience in version management and project management.

## Minority Care: Make Color No Longer a Cognitive Disability

**desc**: Color is an essential information ideographic tool in the game. Artists tend to use color to express the level of equipment, the state of items, or a reminder of the danger degree. These colors can quickly introduce players to the game content, while maximizing the creativity and expressiveness of the artists. Unfortunately, however, this color information is not the case for minority groups.Nowadays, there are many players having color vision deficiency all over the world. However, most of them are not given efficient attention they deserve. Being unable to distinguish some color-related information in the game, those players often fail to fully enjoy the fun of the game. How to make good use of color and enable more minority players enjoy the game is a huge challenge for artists. In the game NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, we paid close attention to the game experience of players having color vision deficiency. We focused on meeting those minority players' core needs and won both market and reputation for the game. The Accessibility Design in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT has won the praise from players with color vision deficiency in STEAM, helping expand approximately 10% of the potential market. In the meanwhile, we are in process of establishing The Accessibility Design standards of NetEase game, aiming to set a benchmark for Chinese overseas games.

## Motherhood in the Games Industry

**desc**: Even in 2022, women remain a minority group in the video game industry. Amongst that group, there is an even smaller minority as well - mothers. Previously, becoming a mom might have meant abandoning a career entirely due to the challenges in balancing the demands of an intense industry with the demands of intense tiny humans. Although gender roles continue to evolve, the reality within many households is still that women carry the majority of the household emotional and physical labour, as well as parenting time. In this panel discussion, 5 (4 panelists + moderator) working mothers in the games industry - from different companies, with different family structures, who have or have not taken maternity leave - will provide a variety of perspectives on what has been challenging, what has worked well for them, how studios adapted to support them, and where things have failed.

Through our system, we can quickly troubleshoot the abnormal stage, so as to quickly evaluate the time taken for the system to return to normal. In this speech, in addition to showing the audience how to build this system, we will also show the audience how this system finds various exceptions in practice, such as exceptions in network transmission, exceptions in the task scheduling systems, and exceptions in-game service itself. By listening to this speech, both data engineers, data analysts, QA, SA, and game programmers can quickly apply the ideas of this system to their own game projects and quickly troubleshoot the problems in the game.

By listening to this speech, both data engineers, data analysts, QA, SA, and game programmers can quickly apply the ideas of this system to their own game projects and quickly troubleshoot the problems in the game.

**desc**: Game studios are using open source at an increasing pace, but that's not necessarily good. Like many things, the devil lies in the details. There's much more to open source than getting utilities for free. With just a little thought and effort, open source can be a strategic super power for studios, reducing staff recruiting and onboarding times while giving a big boost to branding. nnCome learn from a corporate open source strategist and the founder of a popular (and open source!) narrative design tool, then take your studio to the next level with open source.

## Oriental Narrative: How to Understand 'Swordsmen (Wuxia)' in Chinese Games

**desc**: Many western game developers are trying and planning to involve some Chinese elements in their games to get closer with and bring sincerity to the vast number of Chinese users. Restricted by language and many other factors, few Western players and game developers can be fully immersed in the Chinese "Wuxia" games in an easy and smooth way. NetEase is China`s first company to develop games with traditional Chinese styles and "Wuxia" theme, and produces such games including Justice, Naraka: Bladepoint, and Butterfly Sword. Those games bring in about 1.5 billion dollars of total revenue and this number is growing. The speaker of this speech, Dr. Zhipeng Hu, is the vice president of NetEase Group. As a fan of Chinese martial arts novels, he has been involved throughout the production of many "Wuxia" games, many of which own a lifecycle of more than 10 years and have outstanding influences in the Chinese game industry. Another speaker, Liu Yongcheng, is the director of the Thunder Fire User Experience Research Center (Thunder Fire UX). He is an expert in design and user research who has been working on user engagement in game development. He has a deep understanding of Chinese users and has extensive contacts with western game developers. From the perspectives of game production and user experience respectively, they will elaborate "Wuxia", the key to the minds of eastern users, to western game developers.

In this eye-opening talk, Ian Schreiber walks through a literature review of the science behind long work hours (and the sleep deprivation that can often come along for the ride) to show a clear picture of exactly what happens.

In this talk, Deck Nine Game's COO Jeff Litchford explores how the game industry promotes talented people into leadership positions and then frequently leaves them to fend for themselves without any real training or mentoring on how to do the job well. As new leads, they are immediately thrust into situations where the consequences of their decisions and actions can run the range from mild to catastrophic poorly delivered work, unhappy team members, failed milestones, all the way to toxic work environments, cancelled projects, and layoffs. Together with the audience, Jeff will identify the actual job description of Lead, explore and explode longstanding leadership myths, and provide guidance on how talented people can become amazing Leads. This talk is appropriate for all departments, all levels of management, and for people looking to become Leads in the future.

Driven by "passion," they're often seen as leaders and MVPs. However, the habits and attitudes that martyrs and mavericks instill have long-term consequences for team and project health. Their work often leads to scope bloat for downstream departments, shortcuts that accrue bugs and tech debt, and mistrust between "less committed" devs who resent the scope creep on the one hand and rogue agents hacking in risky and unaccounted-for content on the other. This talk will examine how the unchecked enthusiasm of mavericks and martyrs can sabotage a team, healthier approaches that can foster sustainable and collaborative passion, and practical steps leads and producers can take to steer devs in a more productive direction without squashing their joy for their work.

## Production Essentials Summit: Production in Media Res

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027939/Production-Essentials-Summit-Production-in
**desc**: Producers are vital in developing projects - they hold teams accountable, uphold the project goals, and oversee resource allocation. Despite these critical responsibilities, many producers are brought on in the middle of development and must identify and solve problems in media res, all while balancing their day-to-day production tasks. Without a problem-solving plan, producers can struggle to put out team fires or, worse, may exacerbate the seriousness of the issue at hand. This talk uses case studies from Filament Games, Studio Drydock, and PUBG Corporation to examine how producers onboarded in the middle of projects utilized various problem-solving strategies to navigate each studio's unique challenges successfully.

## Professional Growth: Growing You, Not Just Your Skills

**desc**: This is a session about working not on specific production skills, but the personal *traits*: grit, resilience, humility, kindness and discipline that we bring to bear every time we learn and apply any new skill on a team. There aren't many talks about trait work; skill development is more straightforward to teach and promises immediate, concrete payoff. But while skills are important, the journey from junior line producer to seasoned executive producer is really a journey of deeper transformation and personal growth. nnI'll use my experience in this talk as a (not particularly good) bike racer as a metaphor for this journey, but you can apply this framework to many different practices. I'll provide the structures to make that practice /deliberate/. We know that thriving in ambiguous problem spaces requires growth; growth requires that we learn to function with a level of discomfort. Attendees will learn to embrace that discomfort, rather than avoid it.

**desc**: NVIDIA provides three SDKs for real-time lighting and denoising. RTXDI implements a set of resampling algorithms for computing direct lighting and ray-traced shadows from many lights up to millions without baking. RTXGI approximates indirect lighting using grids of dynamically updated, ray-traced light probes. Finally, NRD provides a collection of real-time de-noising algorithms in an easy-to-integrate package. We'll go over the main features of these SDKs and the basics of their integration.

**desc**: What happens when the playtest goes badly? Or when your latest expansion isn't embraced by the community? Or you realize your core loop isn't coming together? Changes need to be made. But if you're deeply invested in your design, knowing what needs to change can be hard. Sometimes hearing about techniques other designers use can help shake up your own process and get you out of a jam. The popular Rules of the Game session returns for GDC 2022 to challenge your thinking. Each year we have a group of designers talk for ten minutes each about a unique technique they use to create their games, with each session as advanced and technical as possible. You may or may not agree with any given rule, but they're sure to get you thinking and help you make your own games better.

## Surveying Developer Communication and Collaboration Needs During a Global Pandemic

**desc**: This lecture is based on a university-industry partnership between York University and the International Game Developers Association. It focuses on the results of summer 2021 survey and interview data with regard to how moving to remote work influenced team communication and collaboration ability of a wide array of game developers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the lecture examines reports of mental health prior to and during the height of the pandemic, sentiment toward remote work, the effects of remote work on overall productivity, and how developers feel about various plans for returning to the office (fully remote, hybrid, full return). Despite noting a slight dip in mental health over the pandemic, most developers did not report a loss of productivity when switching to remote work even in light of having to find new modes of communication/collaboration, and few seem keen on a full return to the physical office space.

## Technical Artist Summit: Human Perception of Motion and Animation

**desc**: With the rapid advances in computer hardware and graphics techniques over the last several decades we are now able to simulate increasingly complex physical and light matter interactions and produce incredibly realistic images and interactive scenes. We must, however, pay significant attention to how these are perceived and interpreted by human visual system. While our vision is highly effective in the everyday sense, there are many evolutionary adaptations and peculiarities that technically make the system inaccurate and prone to misinterpretation. It is also the case that some elements of visual scenes are of much higher importance for our perception while others may well be de-emphasized or completely ignored. The challenge for computer graphics is thus to maximize rendering the former and minimize the latter in order to display interactive scenes efficiently. In the talk presented at GDC 2021: "Better Computer Graphics through Understanding of Human Visual System" multiple issues related to human visual perception of static images were overviewed, notably shape, hue, shadows and illumination perception. In this talk we would like to discuss important follow-up topics related to effects of motion and animation on human perception such as human perception of the frame rate, motion recognition at different angles of the visual field, effect of color on motion recognition, optic flows and space perception.

## Three Opportunities to Improve Character Design in the Games Industry

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027690/Three-Opportunities-to-Improve-Character
**desc**: Why have video game characters historically been portrayed in stereotypical ways and what, if anything, have game designers done to confront this issue at their studios? Tapping into rigorous academic research conducted by the speaker, this lecture shares historical trends in game character design over the years and conveys insights pulled from 19 interviews with game designers about how these tropes have been encouraged, maintained, and eventually challenged in professional game studios. This research found that stereotypical and status quo character designs were historically institutionalized as normalized design practices, aided by a largely homogenous (i.e., mostly male and mostly white) labor force in the games industry. Building off these themes, this lecture discusses three key opportunities for industry practitioners and educations to challenge the status quo in game character design and ultimately adopt a more inclusive approach.

## Tools Summit: File System Tricks for Safe Incremental Builds

**desc**: Most game engines provide an incremental build system, however, they are notoriously tricky to implement. Subtle bugs can cause out-of-date or corrupt data to 'leak' from one build to the next, causing subsequent builds to become unreliable over time. nnUnfortunately, developers often do not have the bandwidth (or proper licenses) to fix these bugs, so they revert back to using hours-long clean builds, abandoning the benefits of incremental. nnThis talk presents an engine-agnostic system that uses file-system snapshots and virtual volumes to turn leaky incremental builds into perfectly reliable ones. We will discuss the unique benefits of virtual file systems, and how we have integrated them into our build process with Unity.

With the advent of great natural procedural modelers there is a need to provide the same level of service for urban content. Threedee proposes a novel approach to describe such environments that is easy to learn, artist friendly and with a large variation spectrum. We will present the way we have overcome traditional limitations of architectural content generation. In particular, we will introduce the concept of responsive geometry which allows us to create a more productive workflow generating high quality 3D cities . Artist involvement is key to high quality results so our model drastically reduces the number of instructions and includes drawing tools for many of those. Our goal is to make threedee available to all regardless of background.

With AAA game source data exceeding 10 TB, and content creators needing to work across multiple branches, it has become steadily less practical to require these volumes of data transfer. When the Covid-19 pandemic sent all of our employees to work from their homes, our development process ran into the limitations of multi-day network data transfers and we were faced with the need to physically transport hard drives back and forth. VirtualSync is our answer: a virtual file system that seamlessly fetches assets on-demand as-needed, allowing us to shrink up-front syncs by 98% or more. We show how this simple idea requires a number of complex engineering challenges to be solved. We will present numerous problems encountered and the solutions we developed to solve performance issues, operating system limitations, service monitoring at scale and more.

## Visual Effects Summit: How to Think like a Scripted Particle

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027901/Visual-Effects-Summit-How-to
**desc**: With the advent of scripted particle tools like Niagara, PopcornFX, and VFX Graph, artists are faced with a Pandora's Box of functionality. Flashy tech demos show off complex setups with impressive but sometimes impractical results, and the average user is often stuck wondering if it's even worth learning. Using practical scenarios, Firewalk Studios' Senior FX Artist, Phillip James, will show you that you don't need to have a degree in computer science or years of deep technical experience to start reaping the benefits of scripted particles. Once you take the time to really learn how to think like a scripted particle, you'll never want to go back to the days of restrictive built-in modules.

## Voices in the Machine: Making Space for Yourself in AAA

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028047/Voices-in-the-Machine-Making
**desc**: AAA productions are often massive endeavors that involve huge amounts of planning, resources, and individuals working together around the world. As a creator it's easy to lose yourself in "the machine". But the industry is in desperate need of personal voices, and over the course of the development of Far Cry 6, as one of the keepers of the game's vision there is a very real danger of not only losing your own identity in such a large development but also falling into the trap of playing it safe. nnBut you can't separate the personal from the creative. Whether it's personal life experiences, mental health, or your own unique perspective. This talks outlines a methodology to find your personal voice within a massive framework and how to elevate other voices as well to support individual creators as the heart of game development no matter the scale of the project.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028031/XAI-Enhanced-Data-Driven-Player
**desc**: This talk will introduce a new churn analysis framework for online games, which utilizes XAI to automatically mine the possible churn cases, provides actionable advice for further specific improvements, and tracks and evaluate the "post-treatment" effects for each adjustment.
