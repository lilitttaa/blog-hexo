## 'Cultist Simulator': Designing an Experimental Game for Commercial Success

**desc**: 'Cultist Simulator' was an experimental project which used consciously unusual design decisions to create an unconventional and even divisive game. It hit #1 on Steam and sold more than 50K copies in the first month - a lot of that was luck, a lot of it was marketing, but some of it was also the result of conscious design decisions. Furthermore, 'Cultist Simulator' was a relatively low-budget game with its total production costs being less than $200K USD, and total production time was less than a year. This imposed specific challenges and constrained the design in fundamental ways. This talk will discuss the challenges and the advantages of the decisions the Weather Factory team made, how they steered a straight course, and what they'd do differently next time.

The Classic 'Tetris' World Championship started in 2010 as a community effort, but has grown rapidly with worldwide regionals, sponsorships from EA, Ubisoft and SEGA, and millions of views online. Carrying on the tradition of the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, the CTWC is an anomaly in esports with its use of 30-year old cartridges and NES systems, augmented with modern technologies to create a compelling competitive environment where one would not normally exist. This session explores how the CTWC format makes the most of odd things like NES Tetris' quirky killscreens, OCR technology, a passionate community low in toxicity and high in intellect, attachment to growing gaming events, explosive memes, and having an amazing role model for a champion. How the CTWC's esports culture reflects back positively to strengthen the 'Tetris' IP and communities will be highlighted.

**desc**: Indie developer SWERY's most recent work, 'The Missing', is a puzzle-action game in which you progress by destroying your own body. Beyond the simple appeal of raw violence, this unconventional game also bears a special, more profound significance, as SWERY aimed to create an experience with complete cohesion of gameplay and narrative, one in which he sought to test the extent to which a game's narrative could influence the player's own life.While looking back on his career to date, SWERY will explain why 'The Missing' was the first game he made after striking out on his own, as well as how he approached integrating gameplay and narrative. He will also explain the ideology and methodology behind his unique style of game design.Note that this session will completely spoil anything and everything about 'The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories'.

They flooded the market with over 1,500 auto-generated slot machine games, got 1.6 million installs, made money (!!), received some very strange emails, made it big in Iran, and garnered a stupefying number of good reviews on Google Play. They even enlisted the talents of an honest-to-God MIT statistician.Take a fantastic tour of the weird, dark underbelly of the mobile app market. Marvel as the speakers share their experience with pushing the limits of automation as well as the rate limits of every public API under the sun. Silently judge the questionable ethics of their enterprise. By the end, you may be reconsidering your life choices as Alex and Ziba debate the merits of quantity over quality.

We will present attendees with a broad range of games players with disabilities play, and describe the value that games bring to this distinct group of players. We will close by introducing attendees to a new design thinking tool derived from this player data, the Accessible Player Experience (APX) design patterns. APX is 22 design patterns that you can easily integrate into your design process to inspire you and your team to innovate more accessible game experience for players.

## Accessible Player Experiences: A New Approach to Data Informed Design for Accessible Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025719/Accessible-Player-Experiences-A-New
**desc**: The AbleGamers Charity returns to GDC with data and design knowledge that will help inspire developers and their teams to create great accessible designs. With data from hundreds of players with disabilities, we will show attendees what technology players with disabilities use, the options they prefer and show you the surprising results about the overlaps of technology use between groups of players with disabilities. We will present attendees with a broad range of games players with disabilities play, and describe the value that games bring to this distinct group of players. We will close by introducing attendees to a new design thinking tool derived from this player data, the Accessible Player Experience (APX) design patterns. APX is 22 design patterns that you can easily integrate into your design process to inspire you and your team to innovate more accessible game experience for players. Using APX to make accessibility decisions early in your design than is current practice, this means you save cost in time and money not having to retrofit accessibility later in the development cycle.

**desc**: The recent wave of "explicit" graphics APIs such as Vulkan and D3D12 require that programmers make use of barriers, events, fences, and other GPU-side synchronization primitives in order to obtain correct results. For programmers new to GPU programming or who are used to other APIs that don't require barriers, it's not at all obvious why barriers are needed or what they're actually doing under the hood. This presentation aims to remove much of the mystery around barriers by explaining how they work on modern PC and console GPU architectures.

**desc**: At the beginning of the project, Sony Santa Monica Studio was given the challenge to reinvent and reinvigorate the 'God of War' franchise. It was early in the process that the Santa Monica team decided that 'God of War' as a franchise could not exist without its main character Kratos. The challenge was to present Kratos in a new light to the audience, a side not motivated by rage and revenge. This chapter was to focus not in the warrior side of Kratos, rather on the flawed man he is. Because of this they had to have a fresh new approach to our animation pipeline and that meant starting over in many ways. This talk will focus on the process of transforming their approach to how they animate their main character and how they evolved in delivering the narrative experience.

Their only hope of escape lies in working together with Katia, a young girl who cannot speak a language the player can understand, to solve the mysteries around them. Atsuko and the team at Amata are striving to have players feel a bond with Katia and to feel that they are communicating with her, despite their inability to use language to do so.

## Art Direction Bootcamp: Building a Creative Future with Artificial Intelligence

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025898/Art-Direction-Bootcamp-Building-a
**desc**: This session will break down into 3 categories all full of fascinating examples and unconventional ideas on potential applications for AI in production: AI in Content Creation, AI at Runtime and AI as a Creative Partner. The first two topics for the most part extrapolate the trajectory current technology is taking the industry on, providing valuable insight into the creative process of tomorrow. The third, however, is a much needed exploration of the subject of collaboration between humans and AI, with focus on what developers' roles are and how they can make sure to always be aware of the value of their creations. If developers are to build an expressive and empowering future, everyone not only deserves, but needs to be part of this conversation today. Building a part that future first hand, Promethean AI CEO and Founder Andrew Maximov is excited to share the insights he and his team have found.

**desc**: In order to inform the process of building imaginary worlds for video games and movies, this talk aims to examine the term "culture" as "story" which expresses itself in the physical world. The story of a culture is written in a myriad of particulars from architecture, customs, symbols, values to transportation systems. Starting from a philosophical perspective, Patrick will show the practical process of using 2D and 3D tools to build shape languages from abstract shapes as a foundation for designing different subject matters for world building including vehicles, costumes, architecture and environments.

**desc**: Video games are undoubtedly considered part of the artistic disciplines. In video games, the process that brings the viewer to beauty is the same as in painting and photography, but in games, there is an element that leads the viewer to interact with the artwork. In this talk, Alessandro Taini will use examples of known video game products to examine what leads the viewer to determine one video game is more beautiful than another, and discuss how beautiful is perceived from a cognitive, non-technical point of view.

## Audio Bootcamp XVIII: How a Systemic Approach to Game Audio Increased Creativity and Productivity for 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey'

**desc**: For audio teams world-wide the complexity of game design, quest for quality, pace of iteration, and sometimes the massive scale means you need to build systems that are responsive and flexible. At Ubisoft Quebec, the audio team realized that their game designs were now in demand of a new approach to audio; one that is more systemic. They could not rely on a traditional manual, minute-by-minute approach to audio design, integration and mixing. This presentation will cover why this is important, how the Ubisoft audio team embraced systemic audio on 'Assassins Creed Odyssey', and how they created and used tools and pipelines to support their internal development with a central focus on the player experience. The session will also cover how the team approached the complexity of constructing, recording and integrating voice, how you can improve the approach to interactive music to support character, emotion and player choice, as well as how the team aimed to maintain consistency of player experience with Foley, sfx, and ambiences. Finally, this lecture will discuss how Ubisoft brought all these elements together through systems that were a friend, not enemy, to creativity.

The history of game sound has seen this challenge approached in many ways, (including ignoring it outright!) yet some of the precious-few books on game music fail to mention the most tried-and-true loop trick of all time! 14-year game music veteran Gerard Marino will blast through 7 field- tested looping techniques and strategies currently being used in AAA-console games, Indie-mobile games, and VR experiences alike.

## Beyond Spreadsheets: Building a Metagame Simulator for Balance and Prototyping

**desc**: Modern metagames have become increasingly sprawling and complex, and yet the tools for balancing them have not kept up. David Morris discusses a new approach to metagame balance that makes this task tractable not by abstracting away the complexity of the system but by embracing every detail of it, which is to say, by simulating it. Sharing his experience of creating so-called "metagame simulators" on multiple projects, he discusses their impact on the development cycle as well as specific examples that demonstrate the simulator's strengths as a tool for giving designers intuitive access to the non-linear, cacophonous system that is their metagame. He also discusses how the simulator creates the possibility of "pre-analytics", which is the analysis of metagame simulator data that takes place before the actual metagame is even built.

## Board Game Design Day: "King Me": A Defense of King-Making in Board Game Design

**desc**: In this talk, notable board game designer Cole Wehrle discusses his designs (including the acclaimed 'Root', 'Pax Pamir', 'An Infamous Traffic' and 'John Company') as part of a larger conversation around player interaction. Twenty years ago conflict-driven designs were the norm. Interaction and player-driven chaos were staples of design. Things could not be more different today. Not only have cooperative and solo designs found a massive space in today's board game market, but even complex strategy games have moved away from direct player interaction.Wehrle will mount a defense for competitive multiplayer designs that don't shy away from giving players the ability to disrupt one another. In this light, designing for king-making (the explicit attempt to bolster another player) becomes the central key to enabling players to occupy the complex strategic positions that produce dramatic narratives. Over the past several years Wehrle has designed a series of games which attempt to investigate the subject of player agency and what can be learned from embracing strategies which push against better instincts.

Mikael and Rik wanted to make counterexamples to the plethora of games that focus on the European colonialist time period and often represents the indigenous people in a very passive way, or not at all. In this talk, they'll focus on what modern board game developers can learn from their study, showing that there are great untapped opportunities connected to the use of contemporary themes and ascribing greater agency and ownership to representations of local cultures.

This community took what was a toy and, without corporate backing, turned it into a game. Then they turned that game into a genre with hundreds of variants and celebrity designers. Growth followed, with 359 competitions registered worldwide in 2013, increasing to 679 by 2016.How did the community achieve this? Was it luck, organization, or both? What type of players does speedcubing attract? What industries sprang up to support the game? How is speedcubing different to the board or video game industry, and how is it the same?

Player experience suffers if a company can't provide consistency across the projects, and so does the company's brand. As such, SYBO needed to find a way to avoid inconsistency in visual and interaction patterns across projects. It was also important to find a solution that will help save time and resources in terms of maintenance.

## Can You Make a Good Game Without Good Play Mechanics?

Historically, this is absolutely correct, when the "value" that a game provides to users was limited to fun gameplay achieved only through good mechanics. But things have changed. Now there are good games without meaningful choices or strategic approaches, and whether you call them games or not, it's a game designer's job to design them anyway! That's why you should learn about them.This session is not about making good narrative/graphics. It's about the fact that there are verbs other than "play" that users can do with a game. To maximize those experiences, a good design with a broader vision than just "good game mechanics" is necessary. Drawing from examples from 'FINAL FANTASY XV', speaker Prasert "Sun" Prasertvithyakarn will share his vision and techniques.

He'll talk about the trade-offs the team made while developing the locomotion of 'Spider-Man 2', the lessons they learned the hard way, and compare them to other swinging games such as 'Bionic Commando Rearmed' and Insomniac's 2018 version of 'Spider-Man'. Swinging mechanics are an interesting beast in that they tend to err on the side of *too* challenging, knocking players right out of a "flow" state, and developing 'Spider-Man 2' was mostly a process of finding ways to make a very difficult challenge accessible. Physics, the controls, flow, ease of use, cosmetics, tutorializing and more will be discussed.

## Compiling Your Story: Using Techniques from Compiler Design to Check Your Narrative

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025981/Compiling-Your-Story-Using-Techniques
**desc**: Programmers are used to their compilers catching tiny logic problems in their code. When you're a writer, it's harder to catch these problems. Wouldn't it be nice if you could run an error-checker on your dialogue?In this talk, Jon Manning (Secret Lab) will discuss how techniques from compiler design, like symbolic execution and control flow graph analysis, can be used to spot problems in your dialogue. For example, it's possible to prove that a certain branch of dialogue can never be reached because earlier decisions made by the player will always render that choice unavailable.Come and learn how to get started with these techniques, and how to use them in your own games to check for problems and to make life easier for testers!

**desc**: Low input latency is key to a satisfying experience in competitive games, but reasoning about latency can be non-intuitive in modern engines with multiple parallel timelines running at once. This talk will tackle latency by analyzing the path that data flows through a game engine from the input sample all the way to the video scan-out hardware. By identifying and measuring segments on this path, a dynamic throttle can be implemented to squeeze the input sample as close to the end of the frame as possible without dropping frames. Special attention will be placed on how latency is introduced in the interaction between the GPU and display scan-out timelines when Vsync is enabled.

## Design Philosophies and Lessons from Developing 'Merge Dragons!'

**desc**: 'Merge Dragons!' is an independent mobile game turned breakout hit. It mashes a match-3-like mechanic of merging directly into a puzzly-collection game with cute simulated dragons. How is such a strange game so successful? Why do players play? How does the game make money? And how did Gram Games manage this with just 1 or 2 designers? Join in this session and Senior Creative Director Ray Mazza will take you on a journey from how this unlikely concept was born, through how the design pillarsof discovery, infinite play, and "merging everything" shaped the design into a deeply engaging game with strong monetization. The session will share many design insights and even a few fun stories, like how a duck accidentally ended up in agame about dragons (and why that is great).

## Designing Two Tasty Cores Three Times Over: The Case of 'Brawl Stars'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025751/Designing-Two-Tasty-Cores-Three
**desc**: 'Brawl Stars' was conceived as an ambitious mobile game: a multiplayer shooter that should be able to reach a large global audience. With controls much more demanding than those in previous Supercell games, a lot of design and prototyping effort was put into making them as simple and as well-suited for mobile touchscreen devices as possible. At the same time, a very small team with only a handful of developers needed to design a long-term player progression system that would be a good match for the team's limited content creation capacity.After the game soft launched in June 2017, its player metrics weren't quite reaching the ambitious goals. This prompted the game team to try to improve the game: not just polishing it up, but making major changes as well, while that was still possible. What followed was a more than one-year long beta where the team tried to decide between two control models but ended up with a third, and redesigned the progression system twice, both fundamental core aspects of the game. This session will present the different controls and progression solutions, and based on metrics, argue that they were all good designs and any one of these six iterations of core elements could have worked.

Miriam Bellard has been referring to this as spatial cinematography. Miriam's talk explores spatial cinematography in theory and practice using examples from GTA V Online DLC (pre-production to final art). A truly cinematic experience can be developed by adapting film concepts such as shots, editing and 2D screen design as well as understanding how the player interacts with and perceives the game environment.

## Game Discoverability Day: Discoverability from Day Zero

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025711/Game-Discoverability-Day-Discoverability-from
**desc**: In this talk, Felix Kramer (Tunic, Neo Cab producer) will make the case for discoverability being a high priority before the work on your game even begins. You're probably a person who has been making an innovative piece of commercial art... for a while now. Or perhaps you're just starting to pitch your idea. Thinking of discoverability as storefront placement or SEO at launch is going to lead to problems, because, well, how are publishers going to find you to fund you? How is a community supposed to rally around your game and champion it before launch? How are you being seen, and are you making it easy for others to see you? Designing with discoverability in mind during development is going to make the late-stage discoverability everyone stresses about much, much easier.

To analyze the preservation of IPs, Electronic Arts' Garrett Fredley will expose the struggles and challenges of his work preserving releases for multiple AAA sports franchises and detailing processes that can apply to nearly every game team.Issues addressed in this session include the construction of guidelines for how preserved work that correlates to several teams (engineering, content, marketing, web and mobile companion apps, etc) should be handled, and convincing teams to follow protocols that best support future re-mastering (convincing them to keep documentation, utilizing version control solutions, etc).This becomes increasingly complex for large-scale organizations like Electronic Arts; even more so, given their sports titles being some of the largest and most complex franchises in their portfolio. Tech issues include the challenges around leveraging tools and technology to take existing, production work and translating that into an "archived" state at such a rate that it can support yearly release cycles such as their sports franchises. This talk will provide practical tips for organizations of all sizes on preservation.

This year's presentation, The Developer's Journey, is a first-of-its-kind combined talk that kicks off with Media Molecule's Siobhan Reddy presenting opening remarks on how her team's upcoming title, 'Dreams' plans to unlock player creativity in unprecedented user-generated detail, following a special musical performance using the game. Next up, Hello Games' Sean Murray takes us behind the scenes during the intense and dramatic launch of one the biggest selling new IPs in recent years, 'No Man's Sky'. He will demonstrate how his team found the grit to deal with releasing an innovative and polarizing game into an increasingly vocal gaming landscape. Finally, game development veteran Laralyn McWilliams then draws on 15+ years of dev experience to close out the session with a talk about finding resolve and inspiration in a stressful environment. Using practical tools and techniques, she'll describe how to stay optimistic and inspired through unforeseen challenges. Part 1: 'Dreams': Unlocking Creativity in Everyone (Siobhan Reddy) In her talk, Reddy will discuss the evolution of Dreams from 3D sculpting tool to full blown game creation engine in the journey to bring the hobby of game creation into the living room for the modern generation. She will also cover how building a studio culture of "jamming" has resulted in everything from creative solutions to development problems, new games within Dreams and literal jams - musical and otherwise - in the tools. Part 2: 'No Man's Sky': Grit (Sean Murray)A small and unlikely team was behind one of the most ambitious and anticipated games of 2016. Hello Games' Sean Murray takes us behind the scenes during the intense and dramatic launch of one the biggest selling new IPs in recent years. He demonstrates how his team found the grit to deal with releasing an innovative and polarizing game into an increasingly vocal gaming landscape, and details how through determination and love in 2019 they have built to record player numbers and positivity amongst their most negative detractors. This candid and open discussion will show the power of focusing on what you do, rather than what you say, in the face of adversity.Part 3: I Don't Want Your Lemons: Optimism Fuel for Weary Devs (Laralyn McWilliams)Game development is a hard business. You've all been through the wringer, whether you're indie or commercial developers, long-time veterans or folks in their first few years as a professional. It's easy to become cynical, and that's the start of the short path to burnout. It's not your fault: there's solid evidence that stress makes creativity difficult if not impossible, especially when it's prolonged. Yet some of us persist, through crunches, layoffs, relocations and even your company closing down. What is it that keeps you here and keeps you creative? This inspirational talk provides practical tools and techniques to stay positive and creative in game development despite the bumps (and craters) in the road, drawn from the experiences of fellow developers with 15+ years in the business. By finding common threads, everyone can find a way to make life's manager take the lemons back.

In this session, Sony Santa Monica Studio will share how they developed its features: dynamic and spatially-varying 3D wind simulation, interactive, boneless tree and leaf sway, ground vegetation character interaction with swaying settle (kickin' grass!), and card cluster LOD and shadows proxies (billboard clouds). To support this tech, this lecture will cover various developments such as fast, accurate, texture flood-filling using mip chains (for uv seams and matting issues), procedural and sparse 3D flow that supports spatially-varying flow rates, and fractal noise that doesn't shift when scaled.Senior Staff Technical Artist Sean Feeley will take a deep dive into the process of creating these systems, and how they operate under the hood. He will examine and share the team's wind content authoring workflow, which was designed to minimize cross-departmental impact. Lastly, he will review failed features and approaches, and describe potential next steps for future iterations.

This was a game that behaved so differently to all expectations of a traditional Hutch game; with an early performance that initially shrouded its signs of success. The talk will help attendees discover what it is like to look in all the wrong places for all the wrong things, that measuring success can be looked at in different ways. From focusing on facets which appeared to confirm the project wasn't performing well, to missing all the ways that 'Top Drives' was so much more successful than Hutch's other products. From conversations on killing the game to grossing over $10m, this talk will enable attendees to spot success, even if it is not where it was expected.

In this session, the speakers will walk through the novel, multi-pass approach used to generate ruins in 'Caves of Qud' based on the procedurally-generated cultures that once occupied them. Each pass applies increasingly fine levels of detail. The early passes formulate the coarse architectural structure. Middle passes fill in details by using Wave Function Collapse, a brand-new generative technique. Final passes provide level connectivity and intelligent dungeon population. In totality, the approach blends several techniques to map a set of cultural attributes to varied, playable game spaces optimized for emergent gameplay.

## Math for Game Developers: Understanding and Tracing Numerical Errors in C++

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026447/Math-for-Game-Developers-Understanding
**desc**: Computer number representations have limited precision. Results of arithmetic operations are rounded to the nearest representable number. The effect of rounding can be hard to estimate, however, it helps to think in terms of relative error rather than absolute error. This session will discuss how computations introduce large relative rounding errors and show how to determine the maximum relative error in a computed value. In C++ code, a tight upper bound for the rounding error can be determined automatically for every computed value by substituting float or double types with a proxy class. The presentation will show how to write C++ functions and expressions such that the ErrorTracer proxy class can be dropped in transparently and helps to validate the stability of your computations.

## Maximizing Animation and Cinematic Content Workflows for 'Just Cause 4'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026449/Maximizing-Animation-and-Cinematic-Content
**desc**: When planning out the needs for animation workflows during the production of 'Just Cause 4', it was necessary to rethink and revamp existing in-house animation workflows and the tools behind it all. This included building further on the groundwork of the pipeline created during development of 'Just Cause 3' for the gameplay animation team as well as building an entirely new pipeline for cutscenes in order to support a stronger push on our cinematic structure. The result was a more robust set of animation content workflows and improved tools that increased efficiency, speed, and quality. This talk will present the process of how the technical animation team went about executing some of the wants and needs of the animation and cinematics teams on JC4 that led to a much improved pipeline.

In this session, Junsik will present how Nexon Korea has developed a real-time automated wallhack detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks with a small dataset and a single GPU. By using Class Activation Maps, the network finds suspicious areas within a screenshot that improves the credibility of the model's performance and makes debugging datasets much more efficient. Model Interpretability plays a crucial role in incorporating deep learning with the existing abuser control policies. As a result, the system now detects abusers in real-time and reduces manual inspection labor significantly.

## ML Tutorial Day: From Motion Matching to Motion Synthesis, and All the Hurdles In Between

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026472/ML-Tutorial-Day-From-Motion
**desc**: Motion matching started a revolution in the way developers create runtime animation controllers for video game characters, freeing developers from the burden of manually crafted motion trees. Games like 'For Honor', 'UFC' and 'Last of Us' are showing the great benefits in terms of realism and animation quality this technique can provide. Still, motion matching can only choose poses from an animation database, with no ability to generate new ones. Machine learning can help you go a step further, from motion matching to actual motion synthesis.This session will cover state-of-the-art techniques (Phase-Functioned Neural Networks, and Mode-Adaptive Neural Networks) that use neural networks to synthesize motion from examples, explicitly calling out important architecture and implementation details, and spark a discussion on how this technology can be used in a modern game development pipeline.

But "shallow" models are often more interpretable and can lead to deeper insights and faster code. In general they are preferable over black box solutions for the problems that they can solve.This talk aims to introduce the topic of machine learning as a tool for "everyday" programming, as a methodology of data-oriented problem solving. The talk will cover techniques like multidimensional data visualization, dimensionality reduction, nonlinear regression and symbolic regression. The presentation will show some examples from concrete rendering problems, but this talk will not be aimed at rendering engineers. Lastly, the talk will show that this methodology of iterative data exploration and modeling is useful to gain insights on the problem domain that often can lead even to solutions that do not require a learned model.

## New Ideas for Any-Angle Pathfinding

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026316/New-Ideas-for-Any-Angle
**desc**: To compute paths for virtual characters we often transform a continuous environment into a simplified grid or a navigation mesh. However, pathfinding algorithms developed for grids and meshes usually return only approximate shortest paths, with unnecessary detours and additional turns being common side-effects. In this session, the speaker will discuss a range of "any-angle" techniques that can help you overcome such difficulties. The presentation will also describe Anya and Polyanya, two new algorithms which not only guarantee to compute actual shortest paths but which can also run 10-100+ times faster than traditional grid-based A* search.

Because the tool captures all of its metrics in a single pass (no frame replay), it can be used on DX12 frames that use asynchronous compute or copy queues. After recaping what the Peak-Performance-Percentage Method is, the talk shows how it can be applied to unlock perf speedups on various workloads, including: compute shaders with large thread-group sizes, pixel shaders with out-of-order completion, ray-tracing BVH updates and ray-tracing denoisers.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026381/Procedural-Generation-of-Cinematic-Dialogues
**desc**: 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey' introduces interactive cinematic dialogues to the franchise for the first time, offering about 30 hours of cinematic content. Around 15% of these scenes are fully procedural and all the scenes still contain some procedural elements in some form. In this talk, Francois Paradis, Programming Team Lead, presents his team's approach to generating all aspects of a cinematic scene, including staging, acting, editing, framing and lighting. He also explains how procedural content generation can complement the work of cinematic designers who can use such a system to speed up their work. Finally, some challenges encountered during the production of 'Assassin's Creed Odyssey' will be examined.

## Procedurally Crafting Manhattan for 'Marvel's Spider-Man'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026415/Procedurally-Crafting-Manhattan-for-Marvel
**desc**: There is much discussion on managing the scope and implementation of procedural systems so that their final output may benefit from manual polish. The presentation describes the open world pipeline of 'Marvel's Spider-Man' and how each procedural system was originally designed to support iterations, and dependencies. Of course, the reality of production provided a larger set of tasks for procedural systems. These dependent elements and areas of the game were in vastly different stages of completion and created parallel pipelines. Insomniac's resulting procedural systems were used to author, modify and monitor much more content than planned. The anticipated and unforeseen challenges became success stories and have laid a road-map for future projects.

## Producer Bootcamp: Starting Indie Game Production Right

**desc**: The first month of production is the time when you can have the most impact on the odds of shipping a great game, not to mention shipping it on time and on budget. Hit projects and doomed titles all share that same, portentous first month when the seeds of success or failure are so often sown. Yet developers often treat each day in that first month of development with less respect than they treat the days later in the projectdays that arrive after so many options have been lost. Based on Don Daglow's work with AAA teams, indie developers and startups in Silicon Valley accelerators, this talk will review five key things producers need to do to make those first 30 days produce the right results.

**desc**: Producers often find themselves the nexus of information on their teams. From managing day to day tasks to developing multi-year roadmaps, production is called upon to provide context, input, and guidance to help make the best decision possible across a variety of development situations. Even at the junior level, producers begin to be exposed to product-wide goals and strategic plans, needing to understand the larger scope and context of the work in order to set their teams up for success. But this privilege of information, when managed poorly, can lead to tension between producers and their teams. By learning to determine what can be shared, when is the right time to share it, and how it could be communicated, producers can help manage information on their teams in a positive and productive way.

**desc**: As a producer, your job revolves around expectations: setting them, managing them, and meeting them. It sounds straightforward, until you start to factor in how the individual members of your team may respond to those expectations. Some will be great at meeting deadlines on their own, while others may require more hand-holding and accountability. Some will be able to set effective boundaries, while others may take on too much, predisposing them to burnout. Some will happily carry out tasks as instructed, while others may need to understand the reasoning behind the task. And, of course, some need to do things their way, or not at all. In other words, there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution to ensure the individual members of your team are meeting deadlines, fulfilling expectations, doing great work and achieving their own goals as well as those of the project.

Unlike actors, musicians, intellectuals, painters, poets, writers, directors, and producers, game designers often publish behind the anonymity of a company, even when working alone. Why do they do this? Where did this norm come from? Who benefits from this situation? And why should it be changed?

This creates a complete dynamic global illumination solution that scales across all DXR GPUs and minimizes light leaking without requiring manual per-probe or lightmap work by artists. It fits into modern game engines by directly replacing screen-space ray tracing and baked irradiance probes. The key breakthroughs are a fast way of ray tracing and updating irradiance instead of denoising individual samples or convolving radiance probes, and a new moment-based depth scheme for preventing light and shadow from leaking through walls.

## Rules of the Game 2019: Five New Techniques from Especially Astute Designers

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025759/Rules-of-the-Game-2019
**desc**: Are there rules for designing games that no one has told you yet? As the craft of game design matures, there's a lot of established best practices that most people agree on. But some of the most unique designers have their own sets of game design techniques that are not common knowledge. In this talk you get to find out what they are. The popular Rules of the Game session returns for GDC 2019 to invite five more veteran designers to talk for ten minutes each about a technique they use that sets them apart from common design practices. The aim of this session is to keep each lecture as advanced and technical as possible, diving right into the details of what makes a given "rule" work. Whether you agree or disagree with the techniques presented, they're sure to get you thinking about game design in entirely new ways.

Its implementation is based on a regular light probe field that is calculated in an accurate way from scene representation (voxel and/or triangles) and allows real-time multiple bounce lighting from semi-dynamic light sources and semi-dynamic scene. This method simplifies an artist's work, and allows them to create realistic lighting on huge scale locations.The talk will cover technical details of the system and how it can be implemented in any deferred rendering pipeline. A number of solutions to common problems are presented, such as how to handle probe bleeding in indoor areas and handle foliage. The session also discusses performance and memory optimization, and optional benefits from using modern ray tracing GPU capabilities.

## Social Depth of Location-Based Play in 'The Walking Dead: Our World'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025937/Social-Depth-of-Location-Based
**desc**: The 'Walking Dead: Our World' is a simple location-based game about shooting walkers in your real environment. As the player learns the ropes, however, seemingly small layers of decision-making depth are added on the simple core loop. As the map location provides players with opportunities, and resource limitations restrict their choices, the players need to balance opportunities and risks to optimize their gameplay. Several novel social mechanics create this smart depth, including player-created buildings persisting in location, complex 25-player challenges where players need to play their strengths, and flares that allow players limited movement on the map.

## Starship Physics and Controls that Feel Real: Bringing the Toys of Starlink to Digital Life

**desc**: How do children play with their toys? They skim them along the floor, tumble them around in the air, and smash them into walls. In Starlink: Battle for Atlas, one of our key pillars was that the digital ship should feel true to how children might play with its physical toy equivalent. In this talk, we will describe how we brought the ships of Starlink to life. By combining specialized but reusable behaviors, designers can control how vehicles handle in multiple navigation modes, as well as how dynamic they look on screen. The tricky bit with highly configurable vehicles is tackling the ensuing combinatorial explosion of tuning that comes from each part affecting the outcome. Finally, relaxing the coupling between physics and gameplay can lead to more interesting environmental impacts and corresponding angular momentum preserving recovery animations.

Countless studios are built as a necessary byproduct of shipping a game, with no deliberate thought into the factors that will actually enable your game to succeed and your studio to thrive. The choices made around product roadmap, business model, marketing strategy, community development, corporate structure, compensation, funding, etc, help set a critical foundation for building a viable business. From countless mentoring and coaching engagements from across the globe, the same patterns around the lack of intentional business design keep emerging.

**desc**: Game designers are adept at creating future worlds, but our collective imagination seems to be stuck on escapist fantasies, dystopias, or re-skinning the present. This session focuses on an undergraduate course entitled "Speculative Futures: Games for a Different World" taught at UC Santa Cruz in which students imagine what happens to our world when major societal challenges are overcome and design games that belong in their speculative futures. This talk will demonstrate how starting with a desired future can lead to novel design avenues, ignites students' political imagination, and results in a transformative classroom experience.

## Teaching Modern Graphics: A Shader-First Approach

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026513/Teaching-Modern-Graphics-A-Shader
**desc**: There has been a shift in graphics programming from the CPU to the GPU over the last two decades. Coding went from serial to parallel. For educators in the field, teaching has not been updated to reflect this massive change in landscape. Most syllabi still treat shaders as a "latch-on" to be taught as a more advanced topic. Having identified common conceptual roadblocks encountered with graphics programming, this talk presents "a shader-first approach" that puts shaders at the heart of teaching graphics from the ground-up. The talk proceeds to show how the methods can be applied to teaching in other domains as well.

## Teaching Puzzle Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025845/Teaching-Puzzle
**desc**: Puzzles are integrated into many games both digital and analog, but designing a great puzzle can be an elusive challenge: too easy bores the player, too hard frustrates them. With the rising popularity of escape rooms and similar digital VR experiences, puzzles can often be the core of the gameplay. In this session, each panelist will present a case study of how they teach puzzle design at their institution, using real-world examples from students and/or professional work. This talk will discuss challenges and best practices specific to teaching puzzle design, and predict the future of puzzles in game design.

## Technical Designers: The Master Link Between Engineering and Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026074/Technical-Designers-The-Master-Link
**desc**: Technical design is still a relatively new discipline in the industry and its power tends to be poorly understood. Having a technical designer on a team is more often a happy accident than a deliberate staffing choice. However, most studios have at least one designer who can script their way out of any problem, or a programmer that can build and iterate on a game mechanic with little to no input from design.This presentation draws on personal experience to highlight that technical design is a discipline that could benefit from a more formal recognition (like technical artists) and show that given appropriate responsibilities, such people can dramatically improve the quality of life of the design, engineering and art departments, resulting in better games.

**desc**: Designer Tracy Fullerton discusses the design challenges behind of translating Henry David Thoreau's classic work Walden into a game and what game designers can learn about creating experimental play from this 19th century philosopher-hermit. This session will discuss specific design problems with translation of a work, which is at its core a rejection of the common aspirations that underlie traditional living, and, by extension, traditional gameplay systems. How can the designer set player expectations in a game world where more is not necessarily better; where time is both a resource to be managed and a simple stream to be experienced, and where the value of actions, items and rewards may not be as simple as they first seem?

It has been evolving extremely fast during the last years with machine learning. Although spectacular, those results belong mostly to the academic community and are barely applicable outside of pure research fields. Still, there is a huge consensus that this field is disruptive, and the game industry makes no exception. Beyond buzz and hype, is it time to incorporate those new paradigms in your productions ?

The talk investigates this question through examining "VFX animation through art history," comparing depictions of water in European Romantic painting and classical Chinese ink painting. The talk argues that the Chinese ink artists come out on top because they explicitly tried to capture the "dao" or "way" of water rather than surface detail "realism."The session will apply this perspective to VFX animation with a demo of how to create fire with leaf textures, taking advantage of the similarity between the *underlying patterns* of fire and leaves. Part of being an effective VFX artist is noticing the fundamental processes, or "dao," or "ways", at work across very different things. So go out into the world and experience many different things!

But sometimes, you return to your true "smoke and mirrors" roots and get away with implementing something that is truly simple and yet has profound effects on the end product. This can be something that is apparent to the player, something that is only visible to the other devs around you, or might be something that only lives under the hood -- known only to you. The common thread is that it's something that makes you ask, "why doesn't everyone do this?"

Time sickness is the belief that time is always slipping away, that there is never enough of it, and that you must go faster and faster to keep up. Those in the games industry can get both physically ill as well as suffer time sickness during crunch. While crunching on 'Perception' while caring for four children (including one toddler and one infant), Amanda Gardner HAD to learn to be flawless with her time management to insure the success of her debut game, in addition to being there for her family. The strategies she used helped free her from the constraints of not having too many hours in the day, and not enough energy to push through. She hopes to share her ideas to help elevate the industry's general well-being regarding crunch.

To handle the increased data load, Insomniac Games set about to completely rewrite their production tools in C++.This talk will explain how the team went about replacing the entire tools stack in the middle of developing 'Spider-Man', without slowing down production. Ron Pieket will highlight several key technologies utilized in the new tools. Implicit sharing eliminates the need for deep copy or mutex locks when handling data in a multi-threaded application. The concept of immutable objects is a radical old idea, newly appreciated. An immutable object is never modified. Instead, changes are applied by generating a new object. The edit loop is a construct that delivers effortless and fool-proof undo, Perforce handling, and more. Ron will also discuss several pitfalls encountered, and how to avoid them.

## Towards Filmic Quality at 30 FPS: Real-Time Ray Tracing for Practical Game Engine Pipelines

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026028/Towards-Filmic-Quality-at-30
**desc**: Ray tracing has long been regarded as a great set of algorithms to achieve high quality visual fidelity. Offline rendering pipelines have largely converted to some flavor of ray tracing in the last decade, craving the expected consistent quality, ease of uniform content setup and extensibility of algorithms. Yet despite real-time ray tracing being a frequent buzzword over the same decade, real-time pipelines have not been able to take advantage of this functionality in a full-fledged manner, yet. With the recent advances in hardware architecture we are starting to see initial adoption of real-time ray tracing functionality into modern game engines, yet the domain is just starting to be explored. This presentation aims to share the lessons, tips and tricks from the integration of real-time ray tracing into a modern unified PBR rendering pipeline for real-time content creation focused on games and other high-end real-time experiences. The author will build on the insights learned by extending the engine architecture to support real-time ray tracing APIs and incorporating the power of real-time ray tracing to increase realism for resulting renders at interactive 30 fps rendering on high-end consumer hardware. Topics of how ray tracing can be incorporated into the artist pipeline for ease of scalable content creation for both RT ray tracing and rasterization-based pipelines will be covered. The author will also share several state-of-the art techniques developed for achieving high-visual quality in real-time rendering with usage of primary ray visibility for higher-fidelity materials including multi-layer smooth transparency, advanced approaches for shadowed textured area lights, support of dynamic indirect diffuse and specular lighting as well as other global effects, such as ambient occlusion and others, taking advantage of ray tracing algorithms. Details of approaches for merging TAA and stochastic techniques along with denoising approaches will be covered when focusing on how to achieve fast frame rates for complex scenes on GPU and CPU. Lastly, the author will discuss the insights gained through this integration and explore some of the limitations and challenges of current ray tracing APIs for modern games and game engine architectures, with several calls to action for evolving the API and hardware approaches for future generations to support the trends from gaming communities.

## What to Do When "Toxic Gamer Culture" Enters the Classroom

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025923/What-to-Do-When-Toxic
**desc**: Recently, with the rise of what has been referred to as "toxic gamer culture," discrimination and harassment have become important issues for video games. Unfortunately, this toxicity is increasingly finding its ways into the classroom. It is common for game educators, especially women educators, queer educators, and educators of color, to encounter resistance and even hostility from students who insist that discussions of diversity have no place in their education. This talk breaks the silence about this widespread but largely unacknowledged problem in game education today and provides attendees with actionable techniques for thriving in the face of problematic student behavior.

## Why Fashion in (Most) Games Sucks, and Why You Should Care

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025774/Why-Fashion-in-(Most)-Games
**desc**: Fashion in games is one of the most downplayed parts of the medium; just like in real life, clothing is an outward expression of one's personality. A game's choice of dress or even the ability to HAVE different outfits (and not just color swaps) is both the gamers' expression of themselves and a way to create more diverse and interesting environments. Character customization, after all, could be considered another form of dress up.Offensive or lackluster fashion can be a representation of the troubling perspective that games have no space for "feminine" interests. Some have captured fashion well (think 'Splatoon' and 'Persona 5'), but much of game development has to catch up on this, like the infamous Quiet outfit from 'Metal Gear Solid V' or the lackluster outfits from 'The Sims 3'. The benefits to paying attention to style? Just think of the success of 'Overwatch' skins, as one example! This talk from Kitfox Games' Victoria Tran explores the recent history of fashion in games and provides multiple tips for success.
