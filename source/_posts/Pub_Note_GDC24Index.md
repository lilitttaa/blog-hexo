**desc**: After 'Cyberpunk 2077's' release, the whole CD PROJEKT RED studio focused on both improving the game and its own way of working. CDPR's Technical Support team (now Player Experience & Safety), which is an example of a team that works between dev and publishing with strong connections to both, actively participated in the 'Cyberpunk 2077' fixing and improvement process. An example of the journey of a 'Cyberpunk 2077' bug reported to support shows how different perspectives are used throughout the process of improving a game. The speaker argues that using all those perspectives results in more relevant actions on the part of the studio, which wouldn't be possible without teams from the whole dev-publishing spectrum working together. Furthermore, CDPR taking the direction of greater togetherness and closer internal cooperation after 'Cyberpunk 2077's' release is discussed.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034791/AI-Summit-Every-Day-I
**desc**: Multiplayer boardgame adaptations require competitive AI opponents for solo play. But what's the best approach to creating these opponents? Temple Gates has scripted a heuristic AI for 'Ascension' and integrated a neural network for 'Race for the Galaxy'. Since then, each new game has used new techniques to improve AI competitiveness. Deckbuilder 'Shards of Infinity's' AI identifies symmetries, such as symmetries between players or cards, to supercharge the speed of training. 'Roll for the Galaxy's' AI is designed with holes in the inputs to speed training without creating strategic blindspots. 'Dominion' introduces an embedding layer, so the neural network can learn not only the cards themselves, but the value of their constituent features. This helps handle the highly variant game state where one of a quadrillion of permutations of cards may be in play. Understanding what techniques are available in ml and which best apply to different game scenarios is a shortcut to getting the most of a nn AI.

Larian invests heavily in character performance, and their recent blockbuster 'Baldur's Gate 3' has received rave reviews for the effort. But how did Larian arrive at those performances? How do performance directors help actors make choices when crafting the personality and physical behaviour of characters? How do they redirect and adjust when things aren't going well; inspire and encourage when they are. How do we inform, but not overwhelm and collaborate to build character with our actors? In this session, Larian's Performance Director speaks about techniques and approaches used on 'Baldur's Gate 3' (and built up over 20 years of directing) to prepare and work with actors for memorable performances.

## Applied Mesh Analysis: Automating Distant-City LODs in 'Marvel's Spider-Man 2'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034403/Applied-Mesh-Analysis-Automating-Distant
**desc**: The New York City of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is roughly twice as large as that of earlier titles in the series. At the same time, new quality and performance constraints required the creation of additional distant city LODs. The manual distant-LOD geometry pipeline of Marvel's Spider-Man and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales was no longer viable. This lecture describes how Insomniac Games transitioned to automated distant-LOD geometry generation. In particular, it covers in-depth the applications of fundamental mesh analysis concepts (dual meshes, the Euler Characteristic, curvature estimation, etc...) to several difficult problems (beyond standard reduction and remeshing) that arise from the unique constraints regarding distant city LODs present in Marvel's Spider-Man 2.

**desc**: Synergy, or effectively "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts," is applied to how knowledge of architecture can lead to emergent environments in the virtual world of video games. Design methodologies employed by notable architects paired with structural design principles, are taught as patterns that can be utilized by artist and designers to create virtual worlds where the user feels completely catered to. Realism of space is often seen as the only benefit when following real world architectural design principles, and this talk expands this into patterns that help guide an artist or designer into arranging spaces that subconsciously speak to the end user. It is the combined effect of many conditions that influence the user, and that synergy can be tapped into with games just as well as the real world.

From there, he provides in-depth details into the development team's early learnings on approaching this type of rhythm-action title. This required approaching their game design philosophy from a totally different angle than they've done previously, essentially working backwards from their desired result for Hi-Fi RUSH.John goes over specific examples of how the team gained these learnings through gameplay and how this approach affected other core elements of the game - specifically, how defining their mechanics with core pillars solidified a "positive feedback loop" for the user and lowered the barrier to entry to enjoy Hi-Fi RUSH. This session covers how Tango approached combining music and the action game genre, but this approach can be applied to any teams attempting to implement creative ideas outside of their comfort zone.

How can we move beyond "good representation" to actively de-biasing players? This talk covers a seven-point framework that games educators, students, and developers can employ to guide conversations and design choices regarding character representation. This framework reveals actionable, evidence-based choices students and developers can make so that their games de-bias players rather than reinforce prejudice, and helps instructors navigate the challenges of teaching less receptive students. Video game representations that are based on stereotypes like those related to race, gender, or sexuality influence player perceptions of people belonging to those groups in the real world. So let's make sure students understand how to make games that are a force for good!

These discussions aren't always productive. What are the best ways to engage in reasoned discussion rather than a mere exchange of difference? What tools should educators teach students to help them better articulate their views and structure a defense of their position?

But something has changed. Students and colleagues are reluctant to raise hands and hesitant to navigate public play after many years apart. At the same time, our physical teaching spaces often sit in tension with hybrid forms of learning. Drawing on traditions of folk games, tabletop roleplaying, improv theater, standup comedy, corporate icebreakers, reality TV, mixed media, and other forms of collaborative, cooperative play, we invite five educators to share a single exercise, lesson, method, or moment that got their students playing face to face.

Contrary to most AAA games, the star of the show is the world in which the game is set, Pandora. Audiences can finally come a huge step closer to living their fantasy of visiting the incredible place they've seen on the cinema screen. nnTo make this experience believable, Pandora needs to have unprecedented fidelity, and feel like everything is connected. Every part of the world needs to have a sound, and every sound needs to have a logical link to the rest of the game. The world needs to react to the player constantly, whether they interact with it actively, or passively. nnThis presentation outlines the creative strategies devised to achieve these goals, how to create the enormous amount of content needed to fulfill this vision, as well as the technology that had to be built in order to realize the team's intentions.

**desc**: Single player games can and should design for player well-being as much as online multiplayer games. In this session, Silverstring Media's Creative Director Claris Cyarron dives into three essential design "plays" that the team used in Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between to facilitate player safety and comfort, even while exploring sometimes difficult and provocative ideas. Learn how to communicate designer intent, give the player agency over their own comfort levels, create inclusive spaces that feel safe, and shape opportunities to check in with your players directly, even from within the game itself. This inspirational and chill talk is not all big promises and smooth sailing, though. nnThe second half will feature a bit of a post-mortem on Glitchhikers, examining where the team encountered challenges to implementing these "plays," where there is room for improvement, and some of the additional solutions we've employed since launch.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when many people shifted to using online spaces as their primary means of engaging with the world, this question takes on renewed importance. To tackle this question, this panel brings together experts on the psychology of games and online engagement with practitioners who helped design a game for empathy and inclusion from the ground up (thatgamecompany's Sky), led prosocial initiatives which helped reshape the character of an online community (Project Discovery in EVE Online), or who seek to harness our industry and player communities for environmental action and other forms of good. Over the hour, the panel will cover the state of community design and management, the holistic context of resilience, and lay out practical recommendations for building better worlds using many of the tools we already have as designers and developers.

**desc**: This talk describes how Frostbite implemented multi platform 16 bit type (FP16) support for shaders in order to increase shader performance, especially on mobile. 16 bit shader types like half and short have advantages over 32 bit types, like occupancy and ALU performance. However, converting shaders to take advantage of half precision types is often not a straightforward process, in particular when accounting for platform and driver quirks. nnThis talk will cover the process of creating Frostbite's FP16 API, which enables shader programmers to write FP16 shaders while the tools bridge the platform gaps under the hood. The talk will also explain the rationale behind embracing FP16 in our shaders, the various challenges and quirks of FP16 in different platforms, and how we worked around them, and, finally, it concludes by presenting some of our performance and visual results on various console and mobile platforms.

A brain-dead three-reel slots game at its core, the title cleverly combines a casual Saga Map and city building meta-game with effective mid-core multiplayer mechanics such as attacking, defending, and stealing ultimately making its popularity appeal far beyond the typical casino player. And this isn't a one-hit-wonder. Earlier this year, Monopoly Go! rehashed a similar formula using dice and the classic board game rather than a slot machine, giving Scopely a huge hit.nnWhat makes these strange hybrid games tick? We'll lift the curtain and delve beyond the obvious. Further, what other casual and mid-core mechanics could potentially be blended with an inner casino loop to entice and keep players hungry to return, play, and spend?

**desc**: Video games are an elaborate deception a kind of virtual magic trick that rely on designers' capacity to weave stories, hide clues, leave puzzles, and surprise players.Designers' deceptions are not always in players' best interests however, and game developers often explore the 'grey areas', sometimes unlocking new player experiences, but also unlocking benefits only in their KPIs and bottom lines.This presentation aims to radically mature the discourse around deceptive design in game development, matching the maturity of discussion for websites and services: to define a list of patterns that can be effectively used to deceive players into doing things they likely would not do without the use of the patterns. For example, games can deceive players by using their mental models against them, eliciting accidental interactions, or employing emotionally exploitative fiction.We go over what deceptive design means in games and introduce and detail novel patterns relevant and evident in recent game design.

This lecture presents the results of a years-long study into AR games and their communities to address this by pointing out what players of AR games are actually looking for, what gets them to spend, and what keeps them playing despite constraints such as costs, distance, or a global pandemic. To put it simply, its not the technology they care about, but involvement and identity!

## Future Realities Summit: Learning from Gender Exploration in VR to Design Better Social VR

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034429/Future-Realities-Summit-Learning-from
**desc**: The feeling of physical embodiment and the ability to find community internationally are powerful drivers in the influence of VR on its users. A subset of the wider VR player base have used these benefits of VR to explore their gender identity and expression inside of social VR spaces, utilizing VR to explore powerful forms of self actualization. While this is a niche user group, we can learn a lot about how they have used existing VR social systems to their benefit because their experiences are more amplified versions of the general impact of VR on the general population. In this talk, an experienced VR designer explores how we may be able to learn from these users and their specific needs in order to design better VR experiences.

But fortunately, life is not a zero sum game. It is absolutely possible to build a long, healthy career in the game industry by creating opportunities for yourself and for others, by raising your own voice and amplifying marginalized voices, and by caring about both profits and people.

Attendees will learn how some foundational graph and tree traversal algorithms work such as breadth-first search and depth-first search. The applications of these data structures and algorithms are also discussed using real-world examples.nnThe second part of the session focuses on low-level programming techniques, providing a gentle introduction to memory management, data-oriented design, and optimization theory. Finally, attendees will be provided with resources to continue their education in these subjects.

Seriously.nnMarketing is an easy thing to overthink, and it would be great if there was one template for every developer to follow in order to guarantee they're doing it the "right way". But just as no game is the same, no intended audience is either, and that means a one-size-fits-all approach to how you "should" communicate about your game is simply wrong. nnSo how _should_ you market you game? In this session we'll outline why _should_ doesn't exist (and can, in fact, trip you up). Instead we'll highlight the range of tools and features available for you to use (or not!) on Steam, as well as the different ways to leverage the and combine them depending on your goals. nnOn Steam, your game is the best marketing tool you have, and this session will walk you through all of the different ways you can use the various tools, features, and events we have to optimize getting your game in front of the audience you made it for.n

Narrative often experiences friction in this process, much to the frustration of themselves and those who work with them.nnThis session will discuss common problems in giving and receiving feedback between narrative and other departments, and how to prevent and remedy those problems. We will discuss why feedback breaks down between departments, particularly in relation to narrative. We will cover scholarly and industry research surrounding interdisciplinary collaboration, and show how approaching feedback with a different perspective is vital to improving this relationship.nnThe intended results of improving interdisciplinary collaboration and feedback are:nnA faster, more creative iteration processnIncreased trust and collaboration between departmentsnHealthier teams across leadership and staff

**desc**: How do newer writers fit into game design and narrative design teams? Do writers coming from the worlds of film and comics have advantages getting work over prose writers? Is it easier to be a freelancer or employee? Do you have the skills to be a writer in this industry? How do you know when you've "made it"? Especially for individuals with little experience and those looking to break in, this session encourages participants to ask veteran writers and narrative designers questions without definitive answers. Anyone working with writers is also encouraged to attend. Whether it's finding the right job, leading writers and improving team dynamics, or establishing rates, no question about the business of game writing is off limits.

## Game Narrative Summit: The Playable Series: Writing Seasonal Narratives for Live Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034860/Game-Narrative-Summit-The-Playable
**desc**: Live games have the ambition to go on for as long as they remain profitable. This means that any narrative needs to be written in a way that could potentially go on forever, too. Videogames aren't the first medium to try this, and specifically television shows can serve as means to understand how to pull it off. But due to their interactive nature, games have narrative potential and tools that are entirely unique to the medium, such as non-linear narrative, emergent storytelling, time-limited events, and using narrative design to convey a story beyond plot. This talk will dive into the manifold narrative opportunities of live games, how to structure seasonal plot with inspiration from TV shows, and how to keep a long-running story interesting for many years to come.

Each of these engines offers a starting point, but they all come at a cost. Some of that cost is financial, but much of the cost is in the form of constraints on the game design or even the technical feasibility of a project. The alternative is to build an engine from scratch, which is often seen as completely untenable.nnThis session will discuss when and why one might consider building their own game engine.

**desc**: Five diverse game devs come together to share their stories and how they all originated from the same ecosystem: the Brazilian Indie Scene.nnOver the past 10 years, Brazil has seen nearly a tenfold increase in the number of game development companies. From 133 incorporated studios, there are now over 1000, with an estimated 10,000 workers in the industry. We revealed this budding indie game industry back at a GDC talk in 2014 and, now, we have come full circle, with an understanding of the reasons why the Brazilian community has experienced this growth. It's been driven by the strength of regional developer communities as well as individual actions that have infused regional DNA into various globally successful games.nnGame developers from titles like Horizon Chase, Pixel Rift, Blazing Chrome, and Sword Legacy: Omen will discuss how they learned to deal with this scenario and came out victorious from it. They'll explain how certain definitions of success don't translate equally across the world, highlight diverse cultural, economic, social landscapes that shaped individual achievements, and inspire you to do the same.

## Independent Games Summit: Challenging or Approachable? Pick Two

**desc**: You've probably heard this debate before. It's a common belief that challenge and approachability are incompatible that making a game more challenging inherently makes a game less approachable. And yet, we _can_ have both! In fact, many recent indie hits are successful precisely because they thread this needle. In this talk, John Austin will break this problem down on a (not too) theoretical level and build a framework we can use to talk about difficulty in games. In the second half, he will explore concrete strategies and case studies from recent indie games that we can leverage to adjust approachability in our games without compromising on challenge or the inherent vision of the game.

**desc**: Whilst the conversations around neurodivergent topics have progressed significantly in the last few years, there have been far too few discussions on the effect of intersectionalities with neurodivergences. For some, a single neurodivergence is their major and/or only identity. However, for many being neurodivergent is just one of their many struggles. Hear from several experienced game developers of different backgrounds and disciplines discuss their experiences as intersectional and neurodivergent creators, and the impact this has on their work and personal lives. Learn more about their unique challenges, joys, and accommodations whilst gaining an understanding of why it is not just "people being difficult".

## Lore, Don't Tell: A Guide for Telling Culturally Rooted Stories Like 'Venba'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034603/Lore-Don-t-Tell-A
**desc**: When players are unfamiliar with a culture, how do we tell a story that's rooted in it? It's a responsibility to ensure players who play the game leave with a deeper understanding of the culture, society, heritage and traditions we're showcasing. But the game we make has its own story to tell, and there might not be the space to be educating all players. It might also be tempting to explain and point out every aspect of the culture to ensure a player misses nothing, but this can do more harm than good. Thankfully, "Lore" is a very powerful tool that video games are great at that we can leverage to solve this problem. In this talk, Creative Director Abhi outlines various techniques used to follow a "Lore, don't tell" approach that let him not only be laser focused on the story he wanted to tell in Venba but also helped him shine a light on the culture he loves with all its details

We show how our game designers use the AI to help their daily work, the challenges, the detail of our in-house algorithm, and the engineering backend to deliver the system. Also, our system and algorithm are generally applicable to other games and address major key challenges on implementing reliable ML system within general production line. With this system, we can evaluate more than 700 stages in one day and find critical bugs, speeding up the QA process significantly.

A showcase on their solution using in-house facial rig, FaceRig, and will demonstrate how blendshapes can be automatically created to suit various character identities. The presentation covers: FaceMixer, which can generate blendshapes from a neutral input, and FaceOptim, which automates the creation of blendshapes and animations from scanned expressions or 4D animation. The presenter also introduces FaceBot, a solution that generates photorealistic face textures and meshes with expressions that can then be fed back into the previous system. By combining FaceBot with FaceOptim or FaceMixer, users can generate high-quality rigged faces for game characters with minimal effort. Future developments include incorporating FaceAnim animation, allowing for more organic and realistic facial animation.

Chairs of the summit will introduce the day with a short glance at Machine Learning impact and how it's helping us all creating better games. Each day covers themes that will be explained before heading straight to impactful initiatives!We present a novel neural material compression technique that is designed to take advantage of hardware accelerated texture compression formats. This approach leans on a multiresolution set of block compressed (BC6H) textures that is subsequently decoded by a small neural network. In practice, our method is integrated into the current pipelines in two stages. At production stage, we use deep learning to jointly learn the texture set and the decoder network. At runtime, we sample the learned textures and then reconstruct the material information by inferring neural network in a shader.

**desc**: Continuous Integration (CI) is a common practice in modern software organizations. It plays an especially important role for AAA game development, where thousands of build jobs are submitted daily. However, the size and complexity of video games tend to inflate build size and duration, leading to a slower CI and longer feedback time. To provide faster CI feedback, studies have explored optimization techniques that can skip steps, and sometimes the entirety, of build jobs. This talk presents an overview of these techniques and highlights their costs and benefits. Then, it introduces RavenBuild, a novel ML-based technique tailored for video games. Contrarily to existing approaches, RavenBuild predicts build outcomes for both code and data submissions, providing full coverage for a game development CI. RavenBuild skips passing builds and therefore reduces the CI cost, up to 43%, while ensuring that failing builds are properly anticipated.

Firstly, they assist beginners in learning and improving, providing examples of exceptional skills and teamwork. Secondly, AI bots serve as teammates or opponents, increasing the diversity and competitiveness of the game. Most importantly, AI bots ensure fair competition, fill the gap when there are not enough players and match players of different tiers with highly customized parameters. In terms of training, we combine reinforcement learning and imitation learning, allowing AI bots to learn a wide range of strategies and simulate human thinking and behavior patterns, possessing human-like qualities and human-AI interaction while also having rich strategy diversity. Through dynamic difficulty control, we can control the operation level of the AI accurately and reasonably, adapting to different skill levels. With the client-side deployment solution, AI bots are decoupled from the core logic of game, improving response speed and ensuring data security. In our demonstration, AI bots have shown outstanding performance in various aspects such as difficulty switching, accurate response, strong adaptability, human-AI interaction, and high stability, receiving enthusiastic praise from both players and our customer.

**desc**: Virtual Reality allows an amazing level of immersion in virtual worlds. But when it comes to locomotion, the ability to travel into these worlds may involve various degrees of discomfort, from fatigue to kinetosis (motion sickness). In Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, the open worlds of the game provide great opportunities for players to explore, parkour, climb, fight or go stealth, all of which presented unique challenges when designing a comfortable and accessible experience. The team presents the journey and share our experience working for several years on designing and building various features and presets to make the game comfortable and accessible for players. To conclude, the team presents features to help with potential fear of height, as players in Assassin's Creed Nexus VR will be able to parkour, climb and reach elevated heights, and can decide to experience the game's iconic leap of faith.

## Obstacle Traversal in the Organic World of Pandora

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034304/Obstacle-Traversal-in-the-Organic
**desc**: Stepups and mantles are an established part of the game character's repertoire, yet with increasingly complex game worlds traditional markup solutions have become increasingly cumbersome. In Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora we wanted to portray the full dense, organic beauty of Pandora while making the motion feel as flowing and unobstructed as you would expect from a Na'vi. In order to deal with these challenges we created a highly generic and (almost) markup-free system for stepups and mantling relying on a minimum of assumptions while trying to maximize freedom of movement. This talk presents the basic philosophy, concepts, and implementation of this solution. The focus is on providing a solid starting point for those just starting out with this problem and some useful tools for anyone working with it.

## Player Mythologies

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034812/Player
**desc**: Designers build games around player fantasies. These typically concern something the player "pretends" to be inside a game. But another kind of fantasy is often overlooked: "Player Mythologies". These are the narratives through which players view themselves as players. Explorer, spy, collector, artist - these archetypes don't just describe a character in a game. Remarkably, they sometimes describe the actual players, and how a specific game or genre fits into players' lives. By understanding these narratives, designers can gain profound insight into their players' mindset and motivation, reshaping traditional ideas of "good" and "bad" design.In this talk, Alex Jaffe introduces player mythologies, showing their impact and their root causes in subtle design choices. He then presents a case study on the player mythology of fighting games. He shows how this lens unlocked his work on Riot Games' 2XKO (formerly Project L), and illuminates the beauty of the genre along the way.

## Real-Time Personalization in Mobile Gaming with On-Device ML (Presented by NimbleEdge)

**desc**: Personalization is well-known to improve gamer engagement significantly. However, most developers rely on outdated, historical user data for personalization, missing out on rich insights regarding session context from real-time user-game interactions. This is largely due to a) prohibitively high cloud costs of handling and processing real-time session data on cloud and b) difficulty of deploying and maintaining real-time ML models on-device nnWe propose a novel approach to overcome these challenges, using our managed on-device ML platform. The platform executes data processing, inference as well as training on-device to deliver cost-efficient, real-time personalization at scale. This results in significant improvement in gamer experience and conversion, with minimal end-to-end latency and CPU and battery usage spike

**desc**: Requirements for game worlds are ever-increasing, being more realistic, more interactive, and larger than ever before. This means that there is a ton of content to be authored, but also large amounts of data to pass through pipelines and workflows to the engine runtime. Remedy has been working on a new data pipeline and technology stack for the Northlight engine that allows us to optimize entity data for authoring at edit time, and performance at runtime, while keeping near-instant iteration times for world editing workflows. The fundamental parts of this technology are OpenUSD for authoring, and Northlight's transformative live-edit pipeline that enables entity modifications to be applied to a running game process on the fly. In this presentation, Sebastian shares how we keep the editor and runtime data representations separated, how the data is transformed, and how the real-time editing between the editor and runtime works in practice.

Overall, do today's subscription services give everyone a better opportunity to be financially successful, or do they shorten the period in which to turn a profit? Dive into it in this session. There are clearly big winners in the subscription marketplace, however this talk gives an outline of impact in the wider games market. These include considerations for indie publishers when defining a title's subscription and broader lifecycle strategy, in addition to how game development can be tailored for games heading to subscription services in order to maximize player reach and engagement. The belief that when a title enters a subscription service, global pricing and traditional physical retailer support drops, is also explored.

**desc**: Converting a videogame to a tabletop game should be simple - it provides a setting, game mechanics, and an existing audience. But how much should it be like the videogame and/or other games? If it's too similar, players won't need it. If it's too different, players won't like it.nnFormed over 4 years of designing Fallout: Wasteland Warfare and all of its expansions, campaigns, AI and RPG (plus 20+ years of game design experience), this talk examines how Bethesda's award-winning Fallout videogame series was converted to the tabletop game of Fallout: Wasteland Warfare.nnUsing examples, this talk looks at the problems of the task and the methods used to solve them. Plus, the talk examines the deeper, ever-present question during this type of development: When to be the same and when to be different, in terms of the game mechanics, the setting and the competition.

**desc**: If film, video games, and fiction can have elements, what are the elements of tabletop roleplaying games? This panel presents a rubric for general elements that can be found in most, if not all, tabletop roleplaying games. It is less about establishing universal principles that will make a tabletop roleplaying game "bad" or "good," and more about starting a discussion about tabletop games that players and designers can both benefit from. Any kind of review or critical discussion about a games medium cannot start without definitions. By dissecting these nine elements Fantasy, World, Body, Tension, Design, Principles, Form, Touch, and Intentthe panel presents important questions that designers may ask themselves during the practice of their art. And, through providing starting definitions and presenting examples of tabletop games themselves, create critical scaffolding for tabletop roleplaying games as a vehicle for storytelling.

The power of procedural systems in production is widely recognized and it's hard to name a studio that isn't taking advantage of them. It allows efficient, rapid generation and iteration of a vast amount of content in game development. Unfortunately, the development of production ready procedural systems themselves can be far from an efficient process. This presentation uses successful and less than successful examples from Marvel's Spider-Man 2 production in a guide to development and implementation of procedural systems from inception.

**desc**: Imagine a company that has only ever made easily-downloadable computer software deciding to suddenly jump into an entirely new world of creation: hardware. A company that's used to almost any problem being solved by hitting a breakpoint and entering a debugger, suddenly facing a universe of atoms, and physics, and far-away factories with lots (and lots) of uncontrollable variables, not to mention shipping companies.Ridiculous? Yes. (Ultimately) successful? Also yes!The journey of creating Playdate, our indie bright-yellow handheld video game system (and now, platform!) was fulfilling, but also challenging, but also really fulfilling. And if you some time to spare, I'd love to share with you a collection of stories about the ups, downs, and inside-outs of hardware development, some key learning moments we had along the way, and maybe even some thoughts about just, you know, running a business in general. Let's have some fun!

## The Way We Work: Embracing Human Sustainability in Game Development

**desc**: The "burnout of entire micro-generations of developers." According to 2020's GDC State of the Industry, "game development [is] an industry driven by young workers who tend to depart within a decade." Reasons for those departures typically range from culture to pay to abuse/exclusion, and more. The industry has yet to address, or in some cases, even acknowledge that the way we work may itself be the root of the problem. We can fix this. It's time to rethink the way games are made. In "The Way We Work Embracing Human Sustainability in Game Development" micro-talks, we'll hear from industry leaders tackling these institutional problems as they lead, build, and run studios. We will share real-world examples and strategy on how to successfully build worker autonomy in the hybrid workplace. Attending leaders will learn how to shift to people-first solutions, develop long-term sustainability culture, and pursue practical solutions to hiring.

**desc**: Deciding your games difficulty is, ironically, difficultnnFinding 'Goldilocks' frustration not too hard, not too easy is perilously tough. Player feedback is essential in the search for 'just right': finding players' 'flow' by controlling the many variables, and examining the experiential outcomes.nnCapturing player data on difficulty offers clarity, but also potential ruin. There are many approaches to game balancing through feedback: internal play sessions, analytics, user research, QA and more In isolation each is a flawed and biased picture of 'difficulty'. Only in combination can these approaches paint the full picture, directing teams to make confident and effective adjustments to difficulty balance.nnThis talk presents practical, player-centric, tried-and-tested approaches to capture feedback on game difficulty from players and peers, bringing together lessons from multiple genres. Attendees will leave with a clear strategy on how to define difficulty, and how player feedback can make it easier to make the game harder.

## Visual Effects Summit: Fracture Animation Techniques

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1034790/Visual-Effects-Summit-Fracture-Animation
**desc**: Fracturing your geometry is only the first step in your destructible asset pipeline. There are many different techniques to animating these fractured assets. This talk covers several different ways we can animate the fractured pieces in engine. By avoiding the need of baking out a simulation, we can allow for faster iteration time and dynamic input from gameplay. During the first half of the talk, we focus on using custom UV sets to add animation inside of a material. Then we cover how to animate the pieces with Niagara by using its Mesh Renderer for mesh flipbooks. All the techniques are covered using Houdini for source art generation and Unreal for the game engine.
