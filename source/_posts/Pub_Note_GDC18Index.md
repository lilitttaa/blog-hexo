## "Advances in Real-Time Voxel-Based GI" & "Temporal Super-Resolution" (Presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024800/-Advances-in-Real-Time
**desc**: Advances in Real-Time Voxel-Based GI (Alexey Panteleev, NVIDIA) (Rahul Sathe, NVIDIA)Voxel based lighting has been around for a few years, but very few games have actually used it so far. In this session, we're going to discuss VXGI, the Nvidia's voxel based lighting solution, and uncover some recent improvements that aim to make it more practical and useful even for VR games on present day graphics hardware. We will also discuss how simple, planar area lights can be efficiently implemented with a combination of voxel-based occlusion and analytic irradiance calculations.Temporal Super-Resolution (Marco Salvi, NVIDIA)Marco Salvi will present a simple, but powerful extension to temporal anti-aliasing that combine anti-aliasing and super-resolution. The resulting algorithm, TSRAA, adds only a small runtime cost, is easier to integrate into a rendering engine than complex schemes like checkerboarding, and allows for flexible amounts of super-resolution.

## 'ARK Survival Evolved': Early Access Composing and Its Unique Issues

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025045/-ARK-Survival-Evolved-Early
**desc**: This lecture will cover the considerations that need to be made when scoring an Early Access title. Namely, how to deal with "audience temp love" and "gamer nostalgia", but also having to be particularly fluid and adaptable due to the nature of "open" development that occurs on these titles. Using the game 'ARK Survival Evolved' as a case study, which had a large early access audience of over 5 million people after the first year, these issues will be covered and evaluated, using soundtrack examples from the game as well as personal anecdotes. The lecture will also cover how to deal with the community, who ultimately are paying customers but also beta-testers and how to take into account their feedback versus your own considerations and that of your dev team.

**desc**: Spring-loaded fists hurled like rockets. Body blows from boomerangs, parasols, and robot birds. Up to four players juking and jiving in kaleidoscopic arenas. 'ARMS' is anything but run-of-the-mill. How do you make a family-friendly fighter that's also rich and rewarding for serious players? Craft motion controls to excite esports pugilists? Nintendo's Kosuke Yabuki, who directed 'Mario Kart 7' and 'Mario Kart 8' and served as producer on both 'Mario Kart 8 Deluxe' and 'ARMS', will talk about the challenges of creating a genre-bending fighting game for a brand-new platform. What lessons can a kart-racer offer a brawler that has players throwing corkscrew punches like tennis players volleying missiles? How do you ensure function follows form, using the Nintendo Switch system's motion controls in ways that feel as natural and responsive as tapping buttons? And what's the story behind a world where protagonists' fists come unglued from their forearms anyway?

## 'Assassin's Creed Origins': Monitoring and Validation of World Design Data

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025054/-Assassin-s-Creed-Origins
**desc**: Given the complexity and sheer size of modern open-world games like 'Assassin's Creed Origins' (ACO), it is practically impossible to validate the integrity and functionality of world data on a timely basis using traditional methods. This problem is compounded by the interdependencies between all the various types of world data (AI, art, design), both hand-placed and procedurally-generated. In this presentation, Ubisoft's Nicholas Routhier will describe how the ACO team successfully tackled this production challenge by using a system of daily automated tests and reports to monitor, validate and visually communicate the state of world game data to the world creation team. He will give concrete examples of how this pipeline helped the ACO team efficiently highlight errors and track regressions, and freed content creators to focus on crafting a stunning Egyptian experience.

This approach has allowed them to cut out the overhead of design documents, instead allowing the game to design itself through a series of constrained, directed iterations. Through bottom-up design, Butterscotch Shenanigans has discovered its most iconic characters, mechanics, and worlds; none of which were premeditated. In this talk, Seth Coster, the studio's co-designer and lead game programmer, will break down this approach and discuss the implications for project and team management.

In this talk, Jon will outline the strategies inkle have adopted to achieve this, building on previous work in 'Sorcery!' and '80 Days'. He'll demonstrate how the game design mixes adaptive authored content and procedurally generated "glue" content to ensure players are always making progress and making new discoveries regardless of which scenes they play, in what order, and what they manage or fail to discover. He'll also discuss how automated testing has been integrated into the writing workflow to empower greater freedom of action.

Game designer Chris Tang talks about a rare comeback story. Despite the popularity of the Atari Games franchise, arcade fighting game 'Primal Rage II' was cancelled in 1997, doomed to be forgotten. Or was it? First as a prototype arcade unit and more recently in emulated form, the game was resurrected through twists of fate and heroic fan efforts, allowing the masses to finally enjoy the 20-year old "game that never was". This unique and heartfelt postmortem chronicles the development, challenges, untimely demise, personal consequences, and eventual comeback for what Engadget called "2017's hottest new fighting game".

However, there are times when their use is not only appropriate, but a powerful and time-saving approach, particularly for small teams with limited resources. This lecture will explain how 'Race for the Galaxy', a digital adaptation of the board game, uses temporal difference learning to power its AI. This knowledge-free system requires no human input to generate training data, which allows it to improve by playing against itself. Through this approach, the Temple Gate Games team was able to dramatically improve the challenge level offered by AI opponents without the significant time investment typical of tuning complex AI.

How does Nintendo come up with its big (and occasionally gonzo) ideas? 'Splatoon' and 'Splatoon 2' producer Hisashi Nogami will share his experiences working with a design team whose goal was to create a game that was novel yet easy to grasp and riveting to play. What were the brainstorming sessions like and what kinds of review processes determined the game's final ideas? How do you make a sequel better while releasing it on a brand-new platform with unique features? And how do you land on a quirky concept like "squid creatures fighting turf battles with water pistols" in the first place? Mr. Nogami, who also served as director and lead artist on Nintendo's 'Animal Crossing' series, will don his lab coat, roll up his sleeves, and divulge lessons learned while illustrating the importance of risk-taking.

## Advanced Reddit Tactics: Front-Paging and Winning Big When It Happens

**desc**: Reddit is now the 4th most visited website in the US, and gaming-related content frequently hits the Reddit frontpage, where it can have a monumental impact on community growth and game sales. However, leveraging Reddit for marketing purposes can be tricky due to the site's quirky culture and intolerance of spam. Moreover, simply hitting the frontpage is no guarantee of success: your content needs to convert! In this talk, Elyot Grant will outline a playbook of advanced tactics for success on Reddit. He'll explain how Lunarch Studios used these tactics to hit the Reddit frontpage 5 times, collect 40,000 email beta signups in a single day, run a Reddit-powered Kickstarter campaign, and become the #1 top all-time post on /r/bestof (until Barack Obama knocked them down). Additionally, several subversive tactics will be discussed, alongside pitfalls to avoid.

To this end, this panel brings designers from across the industry together and asks, "what is YOUR wishlist for AI?" Whether it be character AI, procedural content, animation, speech, or "director"-style pacing and content delivery, the panel won't necessarily focus on the practical of "what can we do" but explore "what COULD we do?" The goal is to give AI programmers ideas for "what SHOULD we do?"

**desc**: The Distributed Art Direction of Edith Finch (Chelsea Hash, Giant Sparrow)'What Remains of Edith Finch' had no art director, or it should be said it had no "one" art director. In what may have been the most appropriate fashion the strange fiction of the Finch Family was brought to life by the eclectic family of developers that passed through the doors of Giant Sparrow during its 4 years of development. This talk outlines the key directional breakthroughs, and how they were brought about by members of the team, forming the final "single auteur" aesthetic of the "triple I" game. Like a family, there were disagreements both long and brooding, and bright and fiery. With each persons taking up an oar for direction they dedicated a part of themselves to the final product. The contrast between the bits of people's hearts and the rough edges that couldn't be sanded down are a part of the final product for which the Giant Sparrow team is glad they shared the load of Art Director. Visual Language of 'Electronauts': An Immersive Sound Based VR Experience (Justin Coury, Survios)Justin Coury, Lead Artist at Survios, shares how they developed a visual language to embody the immersive sound based experience in the VR music creation tool, 'Electronauts'. From futuristic environments to character design and intuitive instruments, Coury will discuss how immersive VR can be otherworldly and intuitive at once. He'll share many of the design challenges that helped bring the 'Electronauts' world to life and how the team made visual decisions to complement the Music Reality Engine to give every user the power of personal expression through music.

(Horia Dociu, ArenaNet)In this presentation, all of the wisdom Horia Dociu has gained in his career, from intern to art director, is distilled down to three, simple, honest, and actionable steps that anyone can apply right now to become a better artist instantly. Through years of personal experience, struggling to grow as an artist, being mentored and directed, and ultimately leading, hiring, and teaching artists across all stages of their development, Horia has learned, time and time again, the same three lessons. He's seen artists of all levels face the same challenges, across different disciplines and levels of aptitude, when it comes to strong visual communication. In his lecture, he is going to share those three obvious, but elusive, pillars of improvement with you, in hopes that you'll apply them, and immediately produce more successful work of your own, or help your team members become better artists, instantly! The Passion Project: Catalyst to Creativity and Cure for the Stagnate (Joseph Sanabria, Independent)This lecture is an informative recount of how a passion for sketching led to interesting and creative opportunities in the entertainment industry. It includes an inside look at the creative process of sketching and focusing on the first stages of an idea as it develops on paper. The talk will include examples of how developers, designers and artists can use sketches to help create a vision and bring teams together.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025329/Beta-vs-Soft-Launch-in
**desc**: The phases in which your game first finds its way into the hands of your players are an intense period when you learn whether your game can make it and find its place on the charts. One of those phases is the soft launch. In the F2P mobile gaming industry, it has become a very familiar concept. This session will go a step back and talk about the beta program which is something not many mobile games are organizing. Using Nordeus' 'Spellsouls: Duel of Legends' as a case study, this talk will explain the processes of both beta and soft launch. It will highlight the differences between those and results that followed. Those differences can sometimes be, as in Nordeus' case, huge and somewhat unexpected. That means a lot of learnings. So join this talk as Nordeus shares their learning points which can help you be more effective in launching your next game.

**desc**: For many game designers, it is a lucrative dream to own a strong IP and build a game franchise, but it is also a tangible vision. So if you ever make a decent game, how can you build on that success and stay true to the world and characters without simply producing more of the same? And how can you prevent yourself from digressing too far from the IP itself? Brjann Sigurgeirsson discusses the challenges, pitfalls and opportunities Image & Form faced when making an even more successful sequel to their indie hit 'SteamWorld Dig'.

**desc**: Having established AI tech in your studio is great until your next game adds demands well over and above what your existing systems were designed to handle. This session describes the changes that Guerilla made to switch from having to support a single human enemy in closed corridor spaces to a game with more than 25 wildly different characters in a large open world. Specifically, the lecture explains how they changed the navigation and animation systems that made the characters in 'Horizon Zero Dawn' move realistically. Additionally, this session will detail how these changes impacted Guerilla's workflow throughout the project.

But despite these advantages, bringing a beloved board game to the digital realm has its share of challenges. Players demand features like async play and strong AI opponents that may not have been considered in the original design. Factors like table-talk and tactility, are difficult, if not impossible to reproduce online. But digital adaptations can offer unique features of their own such as real-time bookkeeping, embedded rules references, and contextual prompts.

## Building an Open-Ended Conversation System for Expressive Game Characters

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025075/Building-an-Open-Ended-Conversation
**desc**: Interaction with game characters has long been striving to move past simply killing them. Static characters ruin immersion and conversation menus are clunky and repetitive, particularly in ultra-realistic contexts like VR and AR. What's needed is a more natural way of interacting with characters that is not only deep, but natural-feeling. Drawing on expertise from both AI and interactive story, this lecture describes the challenges faced when building a system for open-ended conversation. It explains techniques including classifying freeform player input, assembling naturalistic responses from underlying knowledge models, and helping writers author content for a non-linear and combinatorial system.

## By Grabthar's Hammer, What a Savings: Making the Most of Texture Memory with Sprite Dicing

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025077/By-Grabthar-s-Hammer-What
**desc**: Are your sprites making you run out of memory? A common problem facing games that use sprite animations is the amount of texture memory each frame uses, and this is a particularly serious constraint on mobile devices. To solve this, sprite packing and atlasing can be used to more efficiently make use of memory, but these solutions can lead to wasted space in atlases that can't be completely filled. Grabthar's Hammer is a tool the Secret Lab team wrote for the mobile port of 'Night in the Woods' that solves this problem in a more efficient way, by using sprite dicing to maximize atlas usage with minimal wastage. This session will present the technique, discuss how 'Night in the Woods' was adapted to use it, and how sprite dicing techniques can be taken further by using techniques from the world of video compression to get the largest number of sprites out of your memory budget.

**desc**: Recent research has found that machine learning and neural networks can be used to construct animation systems for games in a revolutionary new way with far greater scalability and performance than was previously thought possible. At the same time, current methods for building AAA animation systems have started to suffer due to their sheer size and complexity. Using state of the art research into character animation and recent prototypes developed at Ubisoft's La Forge, this talk will show how many different kinds of data-driven systems can vastly reduce the complexity and man-power involved in building an animation system, while simultaneously allowing for a larger variety of high quality and interesting motion to be produced. As well as the numerous advantages, these approaches come with their own pitfalls and difficulties, many of which will also be covered in this practical and deep dive into machine learning for character animation.

**desc**: Self-collision detection and resolution for cloth is one of the most challenging tasks in physics-based animation. This is because cloth can very easily get tangled in itself, a state from which it is hard to recover. This session will introduce EA's method of simulating cloth self collision using predictive contacts, enabling the EA team to simulate large time steps with only a single sweep of collision detection. This makes it possible to use self-collision to fix troublesome areas on simulated character clothing, or to simulate new kinds of clothing that were not possible before, for only a few milliseconds per frame on a single CPU thread. In this talk. Chis Lewin will discuss theory and implementation of self collision, as well as how it fits into EA's cloth authoring tools.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025378/Data-Driven-or-Data-Blinded
**desc**: In the last decade of data analysis, A/B testing and predictive modeling have transitioned from an afterthought to a given in the game industry. Data can be invaluable in understanding the player and making decisions, but it can just as easily lead the industry astray, or worse, narrow the way the industry thinks. When should you be driven by data, and when should you let your imagination roam free? This session will expose common mistakes and pitfalls, both technical and emotional, as well as provide practical guidance on how to improve the rigorousness of your tests and the quality of your data, and how to make sure you don't lose the forest for the trees.

Although 'Heat Signature' was eventually successful, much of its 3.5 year development was spent on features that were not an especially strong part of the final game, and its most successful ones were among the easiest to add. This talk digs into where the process went wrong, why it didn't with 'Gunpoint', and how it might be improved.

## Designing Text UX for Effortless Reading

**desc**: How can you lure your players into reading large quantities of text, almost without realizing it? With the majority of games capturing a gamer's attention with eye-catching graphics and animation, encouraging players to read more than a few words can be challenging. All of inkle's games ('Sorcery!', '80 Days', 'Heaven's Vault'), rely on interactive text as their core mechanic. In this talk, co-founder of inkle and UX designer Joseph Humfrey will demonstrate the design techniques they use to make the text frictionless to read and interact with. These include the principles of good typography and typesetting across a range of devices. Animation will be shown to have value beyond aesthetics; it can play a critical role in leading the eye. Eliminating distractions helps the player focus on the act of reading. All the design techniques fit inkle's two major pillars of text UX design, focus and pacing.

For the design team at Respawn, however, getting there presented significant challenges. Early development was based on comfortable techniques and led to familiar results, threatening to skew the game to an expected and uninspired place. Fortunately, they found a rapid-prototyping technique they call "action blocks", which became central to their design process. With the development of the level "Into the Abyss", this session will demonstrate how Respawn used action blocks to conceive the level, explore gameplay, and create some of their most memorable experiences. By the end you'll have a new tool to help create fun, unique and surprising gameplay.

## Drives: Helping More Players Get from First-Taste to Satisfaction

**desc**: Drives: those creepy, almost-chemical urges that sometimes seem to be beyond your control: "What's in the chest?" "Why yes, I would like to complete my collection." "Ow! NOW I CRAVE VENGEANCE!"Often, designers approach this topic with tongs and a hazmat suit. Rightfully! They want to avoid triggering addiction, or manipulating their players more than they would like. The speaker will argue that drive stimulation has a clear, positive purpose: to get players through the often-painful journey into skill development, entering a social context, and/or establishing autonomy.All successful games follow this pattern: every one.As a bonus, a significant portion of this talk will deal with the recently-discovered drive called "Tend & Befriend." This oxytocin-based drive has to do with the short-term reward systems that encourages you to make friends and care for others...and has the potential to revolutionize game design (if it hasn't already).(This talk is the fourth in the quite-poorly-named Engines of Play Trilogy.)

Where the dev team launches the ship, the post-launch team not only has to keep it sailing but continually building upon it while at sea! While this may seem like a creative restriction, this session will demonstrate how this is a real opportunity. This talk will focus on two specific examples of taking the resources the animation team inherited in 'Battlefield 1': a rigid weapons system and a mounted soldier and building upon them as content and gameplay systems that liberate animators and designers' creativity. The end result in 'Battlefield 1: Revolution', an enemy-impaling Hussar lancer, and one of the most powerful and flexible weapon handling systems of any first person shooter.

It became apparent during development that some of the strongest, most memorable experiences came from the emergent narrative created by players as they watched their soldiers journey through their campaign, mission to mission. Considering this reaction players and developers had to the game and the 'XCOM 2' team's goal to create more procedural environments, Senior Environment Artist Justin Rodriguez started experimenting with decorating the levels to include small, micro-stories that would enhance the player's fantasy as they progressed through the game. Justin's presentation will explore the various components of environmental storytelling he scattered, hid, and placed in plain view, as well as illustrate details of his process.

## Game Mechanics for Storytelling in 'Monument Valley 2'

**desc**: 'Monument Valley 2' tells the story of a mother and her child, a relationship that evolves over the course of the game. This session explains how ustwo games used changing character mechanics to communicate story progression. 'Monument Valley 2' will serve as a case study to identify narrative elements that are specific to games and differentiate them from other media like books and movies. In games, systemic elements like controls, mechanics and character dynamics can be used to tell a story, in addition to more traditional methods like dialogue and scripted sequences. The 'Monument Valley 2' approach to interactive story telling is just one of many, and it will be compared to how other games use medium-inherent tools to express ideas, tell stories or provoke emotions.

After trying a number of approaches, from optimizing traditional A* as much as possible to implementing different hierarchical and heuristic schemes, the Sauropod Studio team developed a very efficient and straightforward approach that visits an average of 100 to 1000 times less nodes than its non-hierarchical counterparts. Their data structures are fast to initialize and maintain, and user-created maps come with no additional offline precomputations. This presentation will provide all the information developers would need to implement a system similar to Sauropod Studio's in their own game, from node creation to graph exploration, to the addition of more complex game behaviors such as moving agents, stackable ceilings, lockable doors, asymmetrical jumping and climbing, and breaking through enemy walls.

## How Quill Defined Polyarc's VR Character Design Process

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025154/How-Quill-Defined-Polyarc-s
**desc**: When Polyarc set out to make its first VR game using tracked controllers they established player comfort and approachability as their highest priority. The Polyarc team built their world from diorama sized puzzles you interacted with in 3rd person while respecting real world scale. This naturally lead to the creation of a mouse as a main character that the player would use to traverse the puzzles. Ployarc hoped to make their main character appealing to the player, but did not expect the amount of emotional attachment players expressed during playtesting. This lead Polyarc to double down on player interactions within as many places as they could while building out their puzzles. This talk will outline all the things they learned along the way in creating compelling 3rd person character interactions in VR as well as the autonomous things your player's character can do to make them more believable.

## How to Create Great Characters: Depth, Emotion and Player Agency

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025156/How-to-Create-Great-Characters
**desc**: Do you want players to care deeply about your story? Then you need great characters that grow and change like Walter White or Daenerys Targaryen. Your story can only ever be as strong as your protagonist is memorable. But how do you write meaningful character arcs that aren't destroyed on a whim by player's agency? How can you preserve your story's integrity when players are in control of the character's fate? Some people say it's impossible and,indeed in most games, characters don't change. This session will show you that it's not only possible, it's essential to engage players on a deep personal level. Join 'Heavy Rain' Lead Game Designer Caroline Marchal and BBC Drama Producer John Yorke to understand how to create characters that empower players for maximum emotional impact.

Pixar claims this is a huge success and has helped the animation powerhouse score 14 box office hits in a row. Sounds like this should work for game development too, right? Like most games companies, King tried to implement a similar system called the the Product Champions, a team of talented and experienced individuals in production, art, and game design that would advise and help game teams lift quality. This talk is about what went wrong and how the King team feels now, 2 years later, and how they may have finally made it work.

## Inertialization: High-Performance Animation Transitions in 'Gears of War'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025331/Inertialization-High-Performance-Animation-Transitions
**desc**: This talk presents a new high-performance approach to animation transitions that the Microsoft team developed for 'Gears of War 4'. The traditional approach to animation transitions involves blending between the old source animation state and the new target animation state; however this can have a significant performance cost, because one must evaluate both the source and target animation states during a transition, effectively doubling the animation evaluation cost. For 'Gears of War 4', Microsoft eliminated these blended transitions altogether and chose to instead handle motion transitions as a post-process with a technique called "inertialization". Eliminating these blended transitions gave them a significant performance boost because they no longer needed to evaluate multiple animation states during the transition. In this talk, David Bollo presents the mathematics behind Microsoft's inertialization technique, for both vector and quaternion values, and show how it can be easily introduced into an existing game engine.

## Knowledge is Power: An Overview of Knowledge Representation in Game AI

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025172/Knowledge-is-Power-An-Overview
**desc**: Much time is spent on designing how game agents make decisions. However, regardless of architecture, almost decisions require information from the world. In fact, the quality of the decisions (and subsequent behaviors) is often directly related to the quality of the data available to the AI. It's important to provide this data in a form that is efficient and easily interpreted. The session illustrates and explains a variety of techniques for representing and delivering information. This session will cover systems appropriate to action games such as target information and environmental knowledge. Additionally, this talk will address broader techniques that can be applicable to RPGs and simulation games.

While these mechanics of game production are indeed important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: the emotional and elusive feel of being a great leader/producer/project manager. Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session, the speakers will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that they have encountered throughout their careers and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include training your team, building team culture, team morale, providing space to fail, structuring collaboration and using process to tell a story.

**desc**: Telling story through level design is crucial to many games, and when environmental storytelling is central to the experience, the shape of the level describes the shape of the story. But what happens when each major story segment is shaped in a completely non-linear way, while remaining tied directly to the environment? How can you design levels that both tell a story, and allow the player to explore that story in an organic, self-directed way? Designers Steve Gaynor and Nina Freeman from Fullbright share lessons learned during the development of their latest game, 'Tacoma', Fullbright's follow-up to the genre-defining 'Gone Home', and how you can apply these techniques to your own process.

## Level Design Workshop: Invisible Intuition: Blockmesh and Lighting Tips to Guide Players and Set the Mood

**desc**: Waypoints, HUD markers, buddy callouts, cutscenes, forced camera moves and more: these navigation aids are ubiquitous in games to guide players to their goals. But can it be done without them? In this talk, two experts on blockmeshing and lighting present practical techniques that establish mood and naturally guide players through 3D environments. In the first part of the session, David Shaver shares techniques that developers like Respawn and Naughty Dog use to establish natural level flow via blockmesh design, environment art, FX, audio and scripting. Using examples from shipped games as well as custom material created specifically for this talk, David shows early blockmeshing techniques that guarantee proper playtest feedback and verify layout changes work as intended. Attendees will then see many more "before and after" examples of how the best practices presented here improve a level layout's ability to guide the player intuitively. In part two of this session Robert Yang delves into one of the most important yet often overlooked means of understanding levels: light. Lighting is one of the most crucial design tools for setting mood and readability in a game world, but level designers and environment artists often lack the language and theory to collaborate effectively on lighting design. Robert will illuminate what light does for games and show how developers can use it to facilitate specific experience goals for games. Robert's talk begins with a brief cultural history of lighting before moving on to an overview of lighting design theory as well as various case studies.

This talk will largely focus on the lessons learned from 'Secret Spaces', a game which, on the micro level, is about gardening and exploration, but on a macro level is about the relationship formed between a player and the living building they inhabit, and how the building's feelings about the player changes how the player is allowed to interact with the world.

**desc**: Why did we cry at the end of 'To The Moon'? Why is Undertale so compelling to players? iThrive Games' Senior Creative Director, Heidi McDonald, shares the science behind how empathy is built, and what specific narrative tasks relate to those processes so that writers can craft more meaningful and empathetic narratives. Things that are scientifically required for empathy, such as perspective taking and how seeing something from multiple people's viewpoints, lend themselves naturally to stories in video games. McDonald will share concrete examples of this in video games, and will share information from iThrive's Design Guide for Empathy.

This talk will cover the problems faced by the Monolith engineering team and the solutions they implemented to ship 'Middle-earth: Shadow of War'; from taking full advantage of all 6 cores of the current consoles to squeezing out the most from their available 5GiB of memory.

## Physics Driven Ragdolls and Animation at EA: From Sports to Star Wars

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025210/Physics-Driven-Ragdolls-and-Animation
**desc**: By using driven ragdolls that are able to follow animation and react believably to interactions, developers at EA/Frostbite have been able to push the physicality that their in-game characters have, while also being able to get emergent behaviors so that players are not just seeing the same animation over and over again, and do not need animators to increase animation coverage, which can bloat the animation database. This session will show the tricks EA/Frostbite developed when adding this tech to their titles such as improving animation follow, reducing complexity to gain performance, reducing potential bad output poses, feedback into the animation system and networking, and how they used ragdolls to generate procedural animations.

**desc**: Cinematic cut-scenes in traditional games can feel disruptive at times, pulling players out of the experience. In the medium of VR, disrupting player engagement can lead to a total break of immersion. On the other hand, distract the audience too much from the narrative and they'll miss the point of the scene. In this session, Gabor Soos will lead you through PlayStation VR's production examples on how Sony London Studio attempted to strike a balance between player engagement and cinematic cut-scenes.

Building a community around your game in development is an excellent way to connect with people early on. Having a loyal fan base is not only beneficial for the financial success of the game, but provides the developer with constant feedback and can serve as a great motivator to push through the tough times of development. This talk in based upon the experience Stray Fawn Studio gained from their games 'Niche' (a genetics survival game) and 'Nimbatus: The Space Drone Constructor'. Topics include exhibiting your game, crowdfunding, social media, indie dev collectives, cross-promotion, and Steam Early Access.

With ILM's over 40 year history, clients and users alike have come to expect the very best in terms of animation and visuals, but now running at 90 frames per second in VR.Location-based experiences provide the freedom of designing a high-powered hardware platform specifically for a project. In service of higher immersion, forward-looking software techniques can be used, that will be available in the home experience space in the years to come.In this session, Lutz Latta of ILMxLAB and Stephen Hill and Ron Radeztsky of Lucasfilm will present how they designed and built custom high-end multi-GPU systems for some of the locations. They will go deep into the challenges of supporting movie-fidelity animation for characters and environmental simulations, as well as a new approach for rendering volumetric lighting effects, all of which contributed significantly to the goal of immersive, cinematic visuals in real time.

**desc**: How do you fill up 100 square km of wilderness with a terrain changing every day? One of the challenges with a modern open world is its sheer size. Not every square meter of the world will receive the attention of a level artist or a level designer. Technical artists need to be able to fill up this world beautifully, quickly and with flexibility to support numerous iterations to keep the production cost low. They need tools that can automatically fill up a large space, as well as allow fine tuning of smaller locations. Yet while filling up empty space is easy, filling it up so it looks natural is a bigger challenge. Ubisoft's solution on 'Far Cry 5' was to develop a set of procedural tools to generate biomes, texture the terrain, setup freshwater networks, generate cliff rocks and more.

In this talk, Jason Grinblat walks through the novel approach he used to generate histories for 'Caves of Qud'. He starts by laying out some commonalities across games that generate histories, using 'Dwarf Fortress' and 'Epitaph' as examples. Then he demonstrates how he avoided building a full historical simulation by generating historical events and rationalizing them after the fact. Tying in a discussion about the power of replacement grammars, he explains how to produce rich, convincing histories on a tight scope budget.

**desc**: Despite their frequent usage in the gaming industry and community, the terms "casual gamer" and "hardcore gamer" are highly contested and context-dependent. Instead of being prescriptive, Quantic Foundry will slice a large data set of 350,000 gamers using different assumptions and present the outcomes in terms of gender and age differences along with the resulting motivation profiles. For example, they can slice the data by self-identification with the labels such as "casual"/"core"/"hardcore", by gaming frequency, and even by different engagement levels within a specific game. The findings will complicate any simple definition of "casual" and "hardcore" while surfacing many unexpected relationships between demographics and gaming motivations. This is a data-driven talk where the Quantic Foundry team will leverage a large data set collected via the Gamer Motivation Profile that allows them to pivot between demographic variables, gaming motivations, and preferred game titles and franchises.

**desc**: This talk will go into detail on how the 'EA Sports UFC' team rebuilt their gameplay and animation systems around the new Real Player Motion Tech, and the advanced animation techniques developed as a part of that effort. Specifically, the talk will go into detail on the path generation and manipulation techniques used to achieve better coherence between the captured motion data and the motion requests going into RPM database query. In addition, the talk will introduce the RPM Event System, which allows for temporal constraints to be added to motion queries allowing for the full benefits of a motion database system applied to problems that require tighter controls on timing. Finally, the talk will discuss how layered techniques were applied over top of RPM to increase pose variety without interfering with the quality motion generated by RPM itself.

## Real-Time Reflections in 'Mafia III' and Beyond

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025467/Real-Time-Reflections-in-Mafia
**desc**: Specular reflection plays a major role in overall visuals. Many methods exist to compute indirect specular (reflection), however all of the currently used techniques have many issues with image stability, floating reflections, missing reflection anisotropy, etc. This session will share how 2K games implemented a hybrid screen-space and cube-map array tracing for 'Mafia III'. This method combined importance sampling with large screen-space blur. It addressed floating reflections and image stability as SSR/CM blend was seamless but didn't produce proper material response and introduced leaking on high-roughness materials. This talk will present an improved version that eliminates the large screen-space blur with smart sample distribution, spatio-temporal filter, screen and CM pre-filtering. This method works well on whole roughness range and achieves full-res reflections in about 3 ms on PS4 at 1080p.

**desc**: After 15 years of developing 'Killzone', Guerrilla Games made the bold decision to move in a new direction and focus on a brand new genre and IP, 'Horizon Zero Dawn'. To Guerrilla's character team, the massive open world of 'Horizon Zero Dawn' was a giant blank slate with unlimited potential, but from another perspective it provided a host of new challenges. How could they rise to the creative challenge of filling a world full of new and distinct peoples without second guessing themselves and succumbing to uncertainty? How could they build enough content to fill the massive open world without losing the small-team culture they spent years developing? How could they do useful work in an environment where everything, story, mechanics, world building, is constantly evolving? This lecture discusses how Guerrilla Games tackled these challenges, with honest reflection on their successes and mistakes.

The vast majority of environment geometry of the futuristic Seoul in 'Agents of Mayhem' was built not in third party art packages, but directly in Volition's own proprietary editor. This led to huge increases in productivity for their environment artists and designers. Volition's developers were able to rapidly prototype the environment. At the same time, it allowed them to iterate on final quality art for their playable spaces, late in the development cycle. It enabled them to generate organic geometry that would otherwise be time-consuming and cost-prohibitive to create. Finally, it dramatically reduced their reliance on outsourcing.

**desc**: This session will talk through the significant changes that happened to Steam in 2017 and their effect on new games sales: the rise of China, the death of discoverability, the influx of low-quality titles, devs trying to outplay the algorithms, review bombing and other pleasant surprises. Also covered in this lecture are questions such as: who's #1: USA or China and what does that mean for YOUR game? How important is pricing and what are the best practices? Is free-to-play viable on Steam? Why does it seem so hard for successful indies to release a second game? This will be a data-heavy talk with graphs and numbers, so some knowledge of statistics is recommended.

**desc**: Scaling a game studio from 2 people to 250+ requires restructuring, decentralization, and more than a few mistakes. This talk will discuss the four phases that Pocket Gems went through as it grew to a successful game developer with a diverse product portfolio. In phase one (2-25) everyone is focused on a single product and communication overhead is low, in phase two (25-50) Pocket Gems split up and began decentralizing, during phase three (50-150) they introduced a matrix organizational structure. Now, in phase four, they are divided into three large unit and each one is as large as the company was in the previous stage.

This presentation will outline two areas that a developer should focus on when considering whether to license an IP for their game: demographic appeal and market fit (determining whether an IP actually enhances the appeal of the game to a target audience, versus just supporting it or even reducing it) and contractual terms (constructing contract terms that maximize a developer's ability to build an audience for a game). The three example games used in the presentation will provide very specific guidance to attendees on ways to use the framework provided to increase a game's potential for commercial success.

Creative Assembly's Janos Gaspar and Pawel Wojs will talk you through the re-building of the 'Total War' historical team within a new paradigm, where captain, coach, fan and expert are equally important. Where everyone has their opinion, all voices are important, yet the game direction is the overall organizing principle. They will discuss how they formulate vision; the elements needed to set their pillars. The way these pillars are transformed into a team-wide direction by adding the atmosphere, coloring the mood, mixing in the emotion and immersion, player agency and experience, as well as keeping it simple and concise (easy to understand and relate to).

## The Business of Being Indie: A Production Survival Guide

**desc**: Let's face it. If you're an indie, there's a really good chance that you began your studio because you wanted to make games, not necessarily because you wanted to manage people or run a business. Making games is fun. All that other stuff? Not so much. To make things even more challenging, most indies have to figure all of this out without having a production, marketing or business development person around to help ease the pain. In this talk, Amy Dallas will discuss several issues she and her team encountered as they transitioned from working in large corporate environments to working for themselves as a small under-resourced indie studio.

## The Cell Structure: How Supercell Turned the Traditional Org-Chart Upside Down

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025004/The-Cell-Structure-How-Supercell
**desc**: Supercell is built on a unique culture. At the core of this culture is the idea of small and independent game development teams that are called "cells". These cells operate completely independently, one could describe them as their own independent companies inside the larger company. So far, despite their small size, these cells have launched 4 games that have each been in the Top 10 charts for years during their lifetimes. In this session, Supercell's CEO Ilkka Paananen will dig into the lessons he's learned as a founder, sharing his experience from building Supercell, a company that has been structured in a fundamentally different way. After years of leading companies that were structured like most games companies, with management owning the vision and having creative control, he came to realize that games are a form of art, created by talented, creative people and that games businesses need to be structured in a way that allows them to flourish. Supercell turned the traditional top-down org chart upside down, giving the games teams the independence and full autonomy to design games, lead projects and have the final say on whether Supercell launches or kills a game.

This can be something that is apparent to the player, something that is only visible to the other devs around you, or might be something that only lives under the hood, known only to you. The common thread is that it is something that makes you ask, "why doesn't everyone do this?"

In this talk we will look to see if there is any evidence that games are having this effect on us. What would advanced systems literacy even look like? Would we recognize it when we saw it?

## Tools Tutorial Day: Playtesting 'Overwatch'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025012/Tools-Tutorial-Day-Playtesting-Overwatch
**desc**: While regular playtesting is an important part of development for any title, it is critical when working on a multiplayer game. When iteration for designers requires getting 12 developers into a game together, the process of creating and joining a playtest needs to be as fast and painless as possible. Achieving this requires a holistic approach that ties many pieces of your production pipeline together. This talk will cover how a "playtesting first" approach helped guide the 'Overwatch' team's design for their data pipeline, build system, server stack and many other aspects of their day to day workflow.

## Tools Tutorial Day: Tools to Reduce Open Bug Count at Media Molecule

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025439/Tools-Tutorial-Day-Tools-to
**desc**: Media Molecule has iterated a range of tools and tech to optimize their bug flow. This has enabled them to maintain a stable build with few bugs throughout development, allowing everyone to work unimpeded (mostly!). They've developed tools for identifying bugs as soon as code is checked in using an automated testing system. This system is integrated with Jira, avoiding duplicating bugs, and ensuring accurate and complete information is attached to a bug. They have made it simple for QA, designers and artists to report bugs using their chrome extension, with a button to bring up a Jira page and to auto-attach the relevant useful information. Programmers can repro a bug by launching the attached replay on their debugger in a single button press. When they've fixed their code they can verify the fix using the same replay to check it. The fix is checked in and the automated testing system runs then stores, and emails you the results of the smoke test.

## Understanding Your Enemy: A Mathematical Approach to Unit Analysis

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025294/Understanding-Your-Enemy-A-Mathematical
**desc**: Most strategy games revolve around the interaction of units with each other. Understanding the characteristics and performance of units is key for many steps during the development process: from design, to AI decision-making, and as a supporting layer if combat between sets of units is simulated. Creative Assembly developed a new approach that relies on the mathematical principle of Taylor expansion: instead of trying to identify the accurate performance value of a unit in a specific situation, they linearize its performance around a baseline value within the situational space of their game. Therein, they use game model results to determine modifiers for different situational dimensions of their game (e.g. terrain, units involved) and linearize a unit's contextual potential around its base value by using these modifier values.This lecture will discuss the caveats that come with this approach and investigate its application for game design, AI, and on automatic battle resolution algorithm.

In this session the speaker will talk about how he and his team approached prototyping where the goal was for each mechanic to be something players had never seen before, but also intuitive enough to grasp without tutorials. He'll also discuss the challenge of blending these radically different mechanics into a cohesive experience along with the production process his team evolved to try and keep the whole team informed in the face of nearly constant, frustrating, exhilarating change.

## Whose Game Is It, Anyway? How Community Relationships Shape Games: Lessons from 5 Years on the Front Lines of 'Warframe'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025368/Whose-Game-Is-It-Anyway
**desc**: Warframe's strength as a successful free-to-play game is rooted in risk-taking decisions with the hope that players are willing to embrace the risks. Players acceptance is usually only as strong as a developer's ability to justify such changes to a game that has already accepted player time and money. What risks did the Warframe Development team take? How did they recover from failure and build on success? Learn how the Warframe team has worked in tandem with the community team to make strategic decisions, effectively receive positive and negative community feedback and run a successful games-as-a-service title.

**desc**: Often, the most difficult part of constructing AI systems is enabling designers to craft behaviors in as intuitive manner as possible. This lecture addresses that issue by showing that powerful, engaging tools don't have to be complex. Using the speaker's free, open-sourced Curvature AI design and prototyping tool as a demo point, this session shows how the software allows designers to specify knowledge representation, enables crafting complicated decisions, and even allows them to see behaviors in a virtual sandbox. The focus is on how programmers can design systems that enable designers to understand what their AI is doing and why.

The key to a breathtaking world is incorporating unexpected insight, which is hard to convey without words. This lecture will look at the benefits of conveying concepts through architecture, citing AAA titles as case studies. These opportunities range from providing an immersive tutorial experience to enriching lore and providing characterization. Through the lens of architectural theory, this session will critically evaluate the opportunities available in each case study. It'll also take a deep dive into the way architects critique each other and share a formula for keeping comments constructive.

**desc**: Narrative design may be a rapidly growing field in the game industry, but how does it differ from writing? The marriage between the two disciplines can be like chocolate and peanut butter, but it's not always easy. What happens when a writer thinks a player interaction ruins an emotional moment? What happens when a designer thinks a line of dialogue is too subtle to drive the player toward their goal? Who "wins" the dispute? Does it involve a cage match? Join Telltale writer Eric Stirpe and Narrative Designer Molly Maloney as they discuss where writing ends, design begins, and the delicate balance between the two that results in great storytelling.

## Writing Modular Characters for System-Driven Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1025537/Writing-Modular-Characters-for-System
**desc**: Making the paradigm shift from linear to system-driven thinking can be difficult, especially when it comes to delivering good writing. Using examples from the speaker's own system-driven writing ('Moon Hunters', 'The Shrouded Isle'), as well as from games like 'Civilization', 'Darkest Dungeon', 'Dwarf Fortress', or the 'Middle-Earth' series, this talk will explore ways modular thinking can help your storytelling, diving deep into character writing specifically as a metaphor for all system-driven writing. "Orthogonality" proves the name of the game, in terms of character traits, in how those traits express themselves, and even figuring out how to prioritize many types of character information. This session will define the tools that are available to narrative designers to help your player find both satisfaction and surprise in your rich yet responsive world.

## You're Not Broken: Finding Your Creative Way Through Difficult Times

**desc**: During times of turmoil, change and grief, it's easy to blame yourself for creative failures. Everyone reacts differently to these sorts of stress but there's one thing everyone has in common: it makes creativity almost impossible. If you're fundamentally broken, your creative work is fundamentally broken too. Making great games means making ourselves whole again. This talk comes from personal experience, going through multiple rounds of cancer now deemed incurable. It provides tools to recognize when you're deep in the well of darkness, and methods to help reclaim your creativity. Whether you're able to make the arduous climb out of the well or you must find beauty in a journey spent largely in darkness, you can move forward. You can create again. But first comes forgiveness.
