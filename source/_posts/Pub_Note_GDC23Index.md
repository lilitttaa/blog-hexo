## "Good Numbers" in Game Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028788/-Good-Numbers-in-Game
**desc**: Do you ever find yourself designing something for a game and needing to plug in some numbers? If you only need a couple of them, probably anything will do. But it might be that you need a whole set of numbers, possibly even an unending set of them. Where do you start? Which ones should you pick?Designer and spreadsheets aficionado Alexander King shares his solution: Compiling a document of "Good Numbers" that are handy to use in a wide range of situations. In this talk, he'll share what properties make numbers "good" for use in games, and how to make your own toolkit to use in your own work.

**desc**: What if automation games played more like performance art than programming? In The Last Clockwinder, you use the time-looping recordings of your own body to create factories and wild Rube Goldberg-esque contraptions.In this talk, project lead John Austin will do a deep dive on the design process of the game: How they approached creating a recording system that always stays in sync, and wrangled the complexity of freeform player cloning in a 3D interactive environment. He will discuss how they re-engineered the classic automation game loop to focus more on "execution" rather than "planning," and how to design engineering games that don't end up feeling like work.

## 'Dark Pictures: Season 1': 4 games in 4 years: Audio Systems for Narrative Horror

**desc**: Annual releases of AAA content are rare in the industry, but that was Season One of the Dark Pictures Anthology. The studio audio team have delivered 4 hugely varied and consistently high quality audio experiences. Far from being a linear approach to narrative, numerous runtime systems drive the audio experience leading to numerous awards along the way. This is only achievable with solid proprietary tech, pragmatic planning and great team culture. Each game is a mix of incremental gains to core systems, or entirely new approaches both creative and technical achieving the fast-paced output. Condensed production shows the cracks quicker and demands solutions faster and this is a chance to share many of those learnings. In this talk, Barney Pratt will share some of the technical systems, creative approaches and decisions that brought award winning quality to 4 hugely varied horror soundscapes including believable character sound, foley systems, interactive mixing, music direction, worldizing and spatial audio.

## 'God of War Ragnarok's' Visual Scripting Solution

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028787/-God-of-War-Ragnarok
**desc**: As games become larger and larger, designers are tasked with scripting more complex systems and sequences. Programming departments across the industry are responsible for ensuring that the environments and APIs available to designers are simultaneously flexible, safe, and efficient. For the development of God of War: Ragnark, Santa Monica Studio found its existing scripting solution lacking, and set out to alter both the tools available for scripting and how their designers approach scripting as a wholeand in the process give more freedom to designers and programmers alike. This talk discusses using event-based scripting, command deferral, and strong collaboration with designers in the context of creating a flexible, safe, and efficient scripting environment.

What's the value of hiding things just barely beneath the surface? Importantly: How do you make your finite game feel like it's got a bottomless supply of mysteries? With examples from TUNIC's development (and probably spoilers), Andrew offers a model for representing secrets as loose ends, and why the joy of resolving them is not always better than the joy of having lots of tantalizing mysteries.

The game lacks many conventional game design components: There are no scores, no time limits, no fail states, no consequences to choices, and no dialogue. Not only did Unpacking not need these elements, it is a better game for omitting them. What's left when all of these things are taken away? And why design a game like this? This talk will explore the rationale for Unpacking's design and the way it was implemented in practice.

Warren Davis, coming off the success of Q*bert, worked on one such game, Us vs. Them, intended as a kit for the hugely popular M.A.C.H. 3. But despite every indication that Us vs. Them was headed for record sales and widespread acclaim, LaserDisc games became reviled and shunnedorders were canceled, lawsuits were filed, and the arcade industry suffered a major crash. Why? What were the factors that led to this turnaround? Warren dives into the making of Us vs. Them and how the bottom fell out of the industry just as it was about to be released.

## Advanced Graphics Summit: Open-World Water Rendering and Real-Time Simulation

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028829/Advanced-Graphics-Summit-Open-World
**desc**: Water is an essential element in video games, particularly in open-world games. In the past, most solutions relied on pre-generated meshes for rendering and flow maps from offline fluid simulators. In contrast, real-time fluid simulation is rarely used and requires a top-of-the-line GPU to achieve the task.In this session, Zhenyu Mao and Kui Wu from LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS will present Photon Water System, an in-house unified solution for rendering and simulating large water bodies in open-world games. Their solution enables both pre-computing and simultaneous updating of water data (height, velocity, and foams) based on physical equations. This data is converted into an adaptive water mesh on the fly for real-time rendering. Several advanced water rendering techniques, such as CDLOD, are also used for acceleration. An in-depth discussion of the solution's application will be provided.

**desc**: Gran Turismo 7 includes the feature of dynamic time and weather changes to create a more realistic driving experience and the excitement of dramatic racing action. To achieve this, the team at Polyphony Digital implemented a new sky dome rendering system. Sky dome has two main parts: the sky and clouds. The team studied a highly accurate atmospheric model for sky rendering and developed a highly efficient run-time look-up table. Furthermore, they implemented noise-based modeling and lighting with ray marching for cloud rendering. Through this session, attendees will gain insight into a method for rendering the sky dome based on a higher quality atmospheric modelcompared to conventional methods and its use for real-time rendering. In particular, a fundamental technique of atmospheric scattering simulations, the importance of measurement-based atmospheric composition, and accurate Mie scattering will be discussed in detail.

**desc**: In this presentation, Seth Cooper, Associate Professor at Northeastern University, will demonstrate how general constraint solvers can enable highly controllable tile map level generation and editing. Constraint solving allows designers to specify what they want in their levels, rather than needing to determine how to achieve it with hand-coded algorithms. Seth will discuss a system that leverages state-of-the-art constraint solving techniques to generate and edit levels incorporating a variety of constraints. These include: constraints learned from example levels, constraints on what should be in a level and where it should be, and goal reachability constraints. He will demonstrate the system in several games and show applications ranging from infilling and repair to generating diverse sets of levels. He will also discuss more recent and ongoing work using the system to blend features of different games, model more complex mechanics via constraints to create playability examples, and generate graph structures.

## AI Summit: Developing Adventure Game with Free Text Input using NLP

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028755/AI-Summit-Developing-Adventure-Game
**desc**: In the 1980s, adventure games with free text input, such as Mystery House (On-Line Systems, 1980), was popular. However, due to the technical limitations of the time, the mainstream of adventure games was replaced by those where the user selects explicit commands, which aimed at such free text input by users. Yusuke Mori, AI Researcher at Square Enix Co, Ltd., will go into how the team has developed a technology for a new generation of adventure games that can flexibly respond to arbitrary input from the userby utilizing the recent advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology. Using this tech, they have revived one of Japan's most famous adventure games, The Portopia Serial Murder Case (Enix, 1983), in a new form.

## AI Summit: Let Your Agents Plan Together: Multi-Agent Cooperation With GOAP

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028889/AI-Summit-Let-Your-Agents
**desc**: In this session, Gautier Boeda, AI Engineer at Square Enix, covers a multi-agent cooperation system in a world where there is no super-entity that manages the agents, and no shared memory between all agents. This makes the cooperation between AI-agents more natural and believable than a classic cooperation systembased on a super entity managing all agents with a shared memory. The agents can only plan from what they know, have to do hypotheses and talk to other agents to get help. The developers do not need to create fake conversations or behaviors in order to make the cooperation believable, as if the agent thought about it by itself. This system is based on GOAP planning technology with a messaging system. Examples will be taken from two different experimental projects: a character interaction project and a RPG battle project.

Logic Programming is a paradigm where the programmer specifies the "what" but not the "how," by defining rules and goals, but leaving it to the system to figure out execution details. It's a powerful approach for use in games, and this talk describes how they used LP for three different purposes: NPC AI that encoded social norms, PCG code using constraint satisfaction, and build-time tools that verified asset consistency. The talk ends with pointers for attendees to get start using LP in their own projects.

## AI Summit: The Dimensional Curse of AAA Game Balancing: Data-Efficient and Robust Reinforcement Learning

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028868/AI-Summit-The-Dimensional-Curse
**desc**: Game balancing is an important aspect of quality assurance in game development, yet it's time and manpower expensive. In particular, there have been increasing practical and theoretical examples of using reinforcement learning to optimize game mechanics balancing. However, current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms still face some key challenges, which render them less reliable. First, it requires huge volume of data and expensive hardware to learn complex game mechanics. Second, game simulators are unstable while under development process. Third, rapidly changing game mechanics that renders previously trained model useless. In this session, Edgar Handy, Machine Learning Engineer at Square Enix, introduces a set of solutions to address these key challenges as a step to reliable ML framework for game balancing, applied to their latest flagship (unannounced) AAA title battle mechanics, resulting in a cooperation between human developers and AI on improving battle mechanics.

Gameplay is built to elicit telemetry that says something meaningful about cognitive skills, but hopefully is still fun and engaging.

**desc**: As sound designers, we know our work is at its best when it's not noticeable. We want to understand the alchemy between creativity and technology to strike a balance between using tools to enhance our creativity while maintaining our unique artistic voice. By understanding the way that technology can enhance and limit creativity, we can use it to our advantage and create something truly engaging. Starting from research and studies over the past 15 years, this talk illustrates some of the practices that can contribute to a "healthy" creative processexposing ideas around incorporating elements of originality and experimentation in sound design, how "thinking through sound" can help throughout project development, and the way that instinct vs. judgment can conflict. These concepts will be reinforced via practical examples from valuable lessons learned by the 34BigThings audio team during the development of Redout 2.

## BroadLeaf: Real-Time Cinematic Rendering of Large-Scale Forests

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028728/BroadLeaf-Real-Time-Cinematic-Rendering
**desc**: Realistic real-time rendering of large-scale forests is an important, yet difficult, problemdue to the massive number of plant-leaf geometries. In this session, Yixin Hu, Senior Graphics Researcher at Tencent America, proposes a new method: BroadLeaf. For rendering large-scale plane leaves with cinematic quality in real time. Their rendered plant leaves have explicit geometries (triangle meshes) and are single-leaf interactable. To reach this result, BroadLeaf generates and handles the Level of Details (LODs) of tree leaves automatically and provides a smooth and efficient LOD transition. The leaves from different levels are organized hierarchically, which accelerates and makes more precise the LOD selection and culling for reducing the rendering geometry complexity. Learn more about how BroadLeaf is faster and more robust than existing methods, and how it can be easily integrated into game engines or directly used in real-time rendering applications.

**desc**: This talk covers the character and accessory pipeline for Rumbleverse, a 40-player brawler royale where every aspect of the culture is an homage to the glorious traditions of combat. A chief pillar of Rumbleverse is character customization. Players can choose from a constantly growing catalog of accessories to equip on six body shapes, each varying greatly in shape and sizefrom toothpick-thin, noodle armed brawlers, to short, meatball-bellied champions. Building out accessories that are to be stretched to six different body shapes, while maintaining overall appeal and a consistent read, required modeling and texturing techniques outside of standard industry practices. As character lead, Steven Kosanovich was responsible for working with technical artists and designers to develop a character and accessory system that allowed for maximum customization without resulting in broken or unappealing combinations. In this talk, he covers the character design philosophy, accessory pipeline, and accessory system development necessary to bring the characters of Rumbleverse to life.

**desc**: Negative reviews can typically be broken down into one of three camps - the player didn't enjoy the game, there was a bug that prevented the player from enjoying the game, or the player refused to enjoy the game. nnFor the past few years I've been monitoring Steam reviews along side Steam forum posts, reddit posts, tweets, and other social posts, and have identified a correlation between a request for support (in whatever shape it may come) and the posting of a negative review.nnThere is sometimes a precious half hour of time between a player experiencing a complication in play time and posting a negative review of your game. With some simple monitoring of social sentiments, you could prevent some of these negative reviews and possibly turn player grump into gold.

This would allow the platform to perform the underlying network synchronization and developers would have to worry less about it. The platform could use this to optimize performance at runtime by, for example, dynamically adjusting the AOI strategy and network synchronization interval, etc. The design has other benefits as well, such as easy tracking of game data and being able to update the platform with good backward compatibility.

It has a lightweight SOC algorithm, along with an efficiently organized culling pipeline, and an innovative occlusion mesh generator which providing high-quality occlusion meshes for the SOC algorithm.In practice, within about 1.5ms per frame on low-end phones (e.g. iPhone 6s), the solution works perfectly with the game's dynamic open world, reducing draw calls by an average of 65% without introducing any false occlusions, allowing artists to create large and complex scenes without paying too much attention to performance issues.In this talk, Wenhui Tao covers all three parts, showing how to optimize the flow and codes of the culling algorithm for Neon-capable phones, as well as how to cut down the pipeline cost by eliminating cache misses and taking advantage of multi-threading. He will also reveal how to use the so-called 'visibility functions' to smooth surfaces and generate high-quality occlusion meshes.

Yet the broader impacts of this kind of work have yet to be evaluated, assessed, and communicated widely, meaning their value may not be widely recognized at this time. Working with the leaders and community members of Pixelles Montral, Stephanie Fisher and Alison Harvey will outline the concrete and specific benefits of inclusion organizing in creating change in the short, medium, and long term. They also outline their findings on how inclusivity-focused groups and initiatives like Pixelles can communicate their impact to different audiences in a manner that is driven and informed by consent, safety, and privacy.

## Engine Optimization Powered by Big Data

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028767/Engine-Optimization-Powered-by-Big
**desc**: As games grow in complexity and size, the systems they rely on become increasingly difficult to masterand so does their technical optimization. Often handled by experts at the end of a production, the analysis and prioritization of such optimization tasks is a long and tedious job.To overcome this problem, we developed an automated solution leveraging big data platform. We collect, store, transform, aggregate and make profiling data available to developers through standard analytical dashboards and queryable databases. We also engineered machine learning models to prioritize which system would be the best to optimize.We were able to reduce the time spent on analysis and prioritization from hours to minutes. Moreover, profiling questions are now more accessible thus it empowers all developers on their system's performance, making profiling concerns not only an expert field.

This traditional method has been around for over decades and facilitated by the introduction of online payment solutions. However, this method of expressing loyalty to the creator is a passive and one-way street that limits further development in creating interactive engagement in the community. nWEMADE, one of the leading pioneers in blockchain technologies, aims to transform this mundane and simple method of community engagement into more fun and dynamic system that would ultimately change the narratives of community formation.

Starting with Chron X in 1997, all the way through Magic Arena, Hearthstone, and Ultimate Teams today, players have loved TCGs for their replayability and customizability, and publishers have loved them for their relatively low development costs compared to their potentially high revenue. Digital TCGs were among the first free-to-play games, and over the years what that has meant has dramatically changed over and over again. In this presentation, Thandrie Davis, Owner and Game Director of First Pick Games, will cover the most-influential moments of the last 25 years, and dive into the lessons learned both for gameplay and for monetization designers of this game genre.

It is the largest industry-academic collaboration ever conducted. This session will share some unusual research findingsespecially focused on counter-stereotypical populations. In particular, it will focus on different player age groups, which defy stereotypes, and on influential players among groups of real-world friends. By building social network graphs, using psychographic surveys, and combining it all with in-game data warehouse data, there is an unusually complete picture of each player, as well as their communities.

**desc**: The games industry is a tough one. Developers pour years of their lives and eye-watering amounts of money into a project, just to see it wither on the vine in soft launch. What is remarkable, is that when we look back at where it all went wrong, it was usually a fundamental problem lurking in the core loop that we either didn't see, or didn't want to admit.In this talk, Dave Cross the original Lead Designer of Wooga's hit June's Journey, will delve into core loops and how to use them to identify problems early. He will also take the audience through several case studies garnered from 15+ years in the game industry.

Each of the speakers began their careers outside of games and now lead different types of companies in the industry, from a developer to a publisher to a social network. Most developers are familiar with Impostor Syndrome, where you feel that you don't really know what you are doing and, sooner or later, you are going to be found out - all topped off with a feeling that maybe you don't belong. For outsiders like us, not having studied game development and having worked in other industries, the Syndrome is even more pronounced.

## Game Narrative Summit: Building Rome in a Day: A Sociological Storytelling Primer

**desc**: Sociological storytelling is where the story's focus in the game narrative centers on the inherent struggles between larger societal forcesusually told through the lens of characters who must deal with the impact of this struggle. It is character-driven but not about the characters. It's about the struggles and forces that are bigger than any one person. And they can lead to extremely satisfying narrative experiences. In this talk, Jennifer Allaway lays out the benefits of approaching game narratives with this lens, analyzes games that are great examples of sociological storytelling, and delivers practices that guests can take home with them and try in their current games.

**desc**: Creating stories for games is a team effortbut what happens when we stop thinking as a team, and start thinking as an ensemble? How can we tell stories across not just dialogue, but art, audio, even design? Even more radically, how can we foster shared ownership as creators? This presentation will discuss what game narrative can learn from the sister medium of theatre in a pragmatic way: How to use language for elements of time and space to generate story, how to begin the story creation process as a collective, and how to direct methodology for collaborative creation.

**desc**: The GDC Main Stage is back for 2023! In this installment of the GDC Main Stage, 'The Future of Play' is a multi-part presentation about how the game industry is expanding; opening up to new perspectives, opportunities, and challenges. It's about looking forward to the ideas and ideals gaining ground in the industry, and how to make them work for you. Topics include: designing games about experiences unique to marginalized cultures, building a healthy studio culture with a remote workforce, and building a successful user-generated content (UGC) platform that benefits both players and developers. Designing Beyond a Dominant Culture When designing games about experiences unique to a marginalized culture, there are challenges that a person of color finds themselves needing to navigate. Success depends on an intentional approach in team make-up, game mechanics, narrative, and in empathy for the player's experience. Learn about how Outerloop games have made these specific experiences have universal appeal and connect to all players on a human level, while simultaneously dismantling cultural tropes and stereotypes. Building Healthy Studio Cultures While Working from HomeSince the beginning of the pandemic, many studios have had to evolve the way they work to accommodate teams working from home. This talk will examine how to build a remote work culture that is healthy, satisfying, and productive for team members. Jen will discuss her own experience transitioning a studio to remote work, as well as lessons learned over the past year through her conversations with leaders of startups as well as established studios. Because the truth is, when you approach it the right way, working remotely can support the mental health and well-being of teams, individually and collectively. And when your team thrives, your business thrives. User-Generated Awesomeness: Building a UGC Platform that Enables Creators and Players to Thrive User Generated Content has a long and rich history in games, from early modding support in DOOM through Counter Strike, DOTA, Second Life and Garry's Mod to being a core part of Minecraft. In this Main Stage session, Robert Anderberg will cover the key technologies needed to build a successful UGC platform, including core engine features, multiplayer game editing, storage and delivery of user-generated assets and security considerations. You'll learn what worked for ControlZee when building their platform and what absolutely didn't!

**desc**: In 2018, pumped by the success of their first game, Bury me, my Love, Florent Maurin and his team start working on a second project called The Wreck. They had money, experience, confidence, and a great idea to toy with. Things looked bright. But after a year, the vertical slice the team worked so hard on pretty much sucks. How did it come to this? What went wrong? And, more importantly: Is it still possible to stop The Wreck from ending in a wreck? In this session, Florent explains how success can sometimes have negative consequences, how easy it is to rush in the wrong direction, how hard it can be to steer away from it, and how, sometimes, what you really need is a series of kicks in the butt.

Yet we've seen time and again that combat can be extra meaningful when explored from a narrative lens, and even more so when it comes from the team. Dissonant combat may seem unavoidable, but who better than indies to explore that, break it down, and turn the notion on its head? This talk is to encourage a different way of thinking about combat: making it smaller, more compartmentalized, more personal, and, overall, more meaningful.

It allowed the team to win production time over battle creation, to focus on the tactical aspect, while maintaining a high-quality level. To achieve that, the team had to question what the opportunities and needs were for this new game compared to Kingdom Battle. The production went through multiple prototypes, ending with the current system.Every battle is decomposed in 4 layers: Arena chunks, Covers, Navigation, and Enemies and Spawns.Each layer is composed of multiples assets tagged with keywords, which are stored in a library. Multiples tags from different layers can be taken from the library to be used in the configuration files to guide the generation system towards a specific result.

While these mechanics of game production are important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: The emotional and elusive feel of being a great leader, producer, and/or project manager. Once processes are in place, in order to maintain the health of a project the leader must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team, and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session, we will investigate facets of soft skills and share specific situations that we have encountered throughout our careers, and how soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include: bringing your whole self as a leader to the table, building, sustaining and repairing trust within our teams, compassionate leadership, production and leadership from the producers' perspective, and accepting that mistakes will be made.

As a result, many designers willout of ignorance rather than lazinessmake unimaginative grayboxes that lack shape, silhouette, composition... with the belief that the art team will swoop in and just make it look great. Through an in-depth visual postmortem of the first four missions of Gotham Knights, this talk will refute this common silo mentality by examining the impact of having a strong visual direction coming from the level designer themselves, and how maintaining and negotiating it throughout the major production gates might completely change how a level looks and plays.

**desc**: The Global Illumination (GI) system implements the use of surfels as a radiance cache primitive to create and re-create a scene. These surfels are displayed as sparsely distributed voxels which are arranged in a hierarchical way within the graphics memory. This is achieved by voxelizing meshes from triangle rasterization as well as reconstructing surfels from scene depth, scene color and other data from GBuffer. Consequently, this system can be employed on scenes that are completely dynamic and include vertex displacement, procedural mesh and skinning mesh. Moreover, by tracing rays within each frame, the surfels can be updated and, in turn, the GI system can achieve faster convergence.In this session, we are introducing a novel GI system, which provides a more dynamically indirect lighting approach for full dynamic scenes across platforms.

**desc**: The game industry frequently laments the "lack of experienced talent," despite a significant and sustained decade-long increase in the number of people graduating from postsecondary games programs. The problem is not flooding the pipeline with new talent, the problem is keeping highly skilled workers in the industry after they have found work. According to the 2021 Developers Satisfaction Survey, 38% of employed developers anticipated leaving their current employer within three years, almost 60% figured they would leave within six years, and 21% had no idea how long they would stay. This transiency is even more pronounced for members of marginalized communities. Clearly, there are ways educational institutions and the industry as a whole can do better in terms of recruitment, training, and retention. This panel examines recent empirical data, existing industry interventions, and explores new solutions to keep talented and diverse game developers in the industry.

**desc**: Realistic full-body physical interactions have long been a major challenge for the gaming industry. Numerous solutions have been proposed, from basic animation and IK-based solution to more intricate middleware such as Euphoria by Natural Motion. However, many development teams find these approaches are either designed to only function under specific conditions or overwhelmingly complicated and impractical to implement. Machine learning can be utilized as an aid in the execution of realistic full-body physical interactions. Our methods have demonstrated the potential for generating high-fidelity motions for a variety of physical interactions, whilst being substantially more accessible in terms of engineering complexity.

The large scale and its importance for the gameplay poses various challenges for the developers, not least of which is the landscape's enormous scale and the substantial on-disk size of the game.To tackle the challenge of such large install sizes of terrain data, the team developed a novel approach using Deep Learning models to compress and decompress heightmap textureswhich will be discussed in this session. With their lossy compression, the team was able to achieve compression rates ranging from 8x to 18x, satisfying critical games requirements for low storage space. They also kept the quality loss low and free of obvious artifacts, so the in-game experience did not suffer.

**desc**: In this session, Fei Ling and Frei Zhang will tackle the challenging problem of LOD assets generation for mobile games which run on devices with a wide variety of computational capabilitiesarguing that directly minimizing image space rendering loss is crucial to LOD asset quality. This presentation will introduce a novel and unified way of game assets fitting and generation, the whole pipeline is built on top of an in-house Hybrid Differentiable Renderer called Mythal which combines both rasterization and ray-tracing, taking the advantage of their respective strengthsspeed and realism. Armed with Mythal, they can calculate the image loss between reference rendering and LOD rendering, because the whole rendering pipeline is differentiable they can backpropagate the gradients for different rendering stages' attributes, and finally to interested game asset parameters, and then update these parameters with gradient-descent-based optimization methods. They will dive into several LOD generation applications which make their game Honor Of Kings (HOK) run efficiently on mobile devices with diverse hardware specifications, these applications include baked LOD of PBR shading, auto LOD skinning, auto mesh simplification, visibility baking, and more.

## Machine Learning Summit: GPT-3 Powered Text to Lifelike Speech and Animation for NPCs

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028816/Machine-Learning-Summit-GPT-3
**desc**: Performance-driven narrative video games needed NPCs' performance to be realistic and depict a wide range of believable emotions. Accurate sentiment analysis and semantic understanding of the text can better help games' audio and animation content generation. This session describes a novel system in 'Earth Revival', using GPT-3 to measure sentiment and extract semantic features, to automatically synthesize emotional voices and high-quality emotional, expressive full-body animations for talking NPCs. In this system, the speech synthesis system introduces paralinguistic elements to achieve realistic emotional expression, which can produce natural-sounding voices for final game releases or content updates. What's more, the automatic full-body animation generation model uses the multi-modal context of speech text, audio, and speaker identity to produce the arbitrary beat and semantic full-body animation together.This system of GPT-3 powered text to lifelike speech and animation can significantly improve the narrative process and minimize time and cost.

**desc**: In 2019, Riot Games launched Teamfight Tactics (TFT) on an expedited timeline. Since then, the TFT game team has been heavily focused on launching new features and content to improve the live game experience. In this talk, Ran Cao, Staff Data Scientist at Riot Games, will present a lightweight path their scientists used to make progress building reinforcement learning agents that learned to play TFT. They built their own version of the game outside of the game engine that leveraged a neural network to predict outcomes rather than fully simulating the game. With this version of the simulator, they are able to minimize the amount of resources required from the game team and still be able to train agents to play TFT at a high skill level and provide gameplay insights. In addition, they were able to make changes to the game in the simulator and test hypotheses with AI that would have been extremely costly to test in the real game.

## Math in Game Development Summit: A Visual Guide to Quaternions and Dual Quaternions

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1029233/Math-in-Game-Development-Summit
**desc**: Sometimes people say "Quaternions are 4 dimensional". They are trying to scare you. It's no more true than "3x3 matrices are 9 dimensional", and no more helpful either.There is a concrete, 3D way to visualize quaternions. Every quaternion is a mixture of some amount of axis line, and some amount of identity. On their own, axis lines do 180 rotations. On its own, the identity (the "w" coordinate of a quaternion) does a 0 rotation. Having a little of both lets you do rotations by other amounts.We'll use this to see how quaternions are created, interpolated, and composed together. Then we'll use the same approach to understand dual quaternions which, unlike quaternions, can translate, as well as rotate around lines that do not pass through the origin. We'll also see how all of this allows for bug-free animations to be done with code that is efficient and simple.

**desc**: Points, Lines, and Planes are the basic geometric objects that games are programmed with. In "A Visual Guide to Quaternions and Dual Quaternions", we learned how to get rotations from lines. This talk is a sequel to that: we'll see how to intersect planes and lines to get lines and points; how to get transforms taking us from planes to points and lines; how to measure the distance between any plane, line, or point and any plane, line or point; how to do the same with angles; how to project these objects onto each other; and more.All of these can be done in a single line of code, and in a way that is visually intuitive and "coordinate free", meaning that we never have to worry about where we are relative to our origin or our axes. A single mathematical system enables all of this: Euclidean Plane-Based Geometric Algebra (a subset of the larger system described by Eric Lengyel in other GDC talks).

While exhaustion and overwork are certainly part of burnout, they're only part of the story, and individualized solutions do not generally work because burnout is an issue caused by systemic, environmental factors. This series of microtalks will offer attendees a foundational understanding of what burnout is and its causal factors before discussing the long-term impact via personal experiences. Recognizing that systemic solutions must be implemented to tackle the issue, this series will offer individuals resources and implementable steps to bolster their resilience against burnout.

**desc**: What would happen if someone leaked one's company's full compensation information to their entire company? A growing number of companiesboth in and out of gamesare choosing to intentionally do just this. Pay transparency has been shown to reduce gender wage gaps, fight against structural inequalities, reduce recruiting costs, increase retention, and is better aligned with workplace expectations for the Millennial and Gen Z generations. In short, it's better for both the employee and the employer, and it can play an important role in creating a more equitable and diverse industry. In this talk, Matt Schembari, CEO at Lightforge Games, will share the research on open salaries along with the current state of the open salary movement, and he'll provide concrete benefits and challenges from Lightforge's experience practicing open salaries over the past three years.

## Open Source Game Development Summit: Agones and Quilkin: OSS Multiplayer Game Server Service Mesh on Kubernetes

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1029264/Open-Source-Game-Development-Summit
**desc**: Previous talks have looked at two open source projects: Agones, the platform for orchestrating and scaling dedicated multiplayer game servers on top of Kubernetes, and Quilkin, an extensible UDP proxy specifically built for protecting, observing and authenticating game server communications.On the surface this seems like a very powerful combination, but manually integrating the two can be a tricky and intimidating process. You need to know and understand the Kubernetes API and its client libraries, and then tie it into Quilkin's xDS compliant API implementation all through some custom code - which is a large and complex amount of work (and a lot of acronyms).In this talk, Mark Mandel, Developer Advocate at Google Cloud, will look at how anyone can utilize Quilkin's native Agones integration to provide a turnkey solution for proxying UDP traffic to game serversproviding an extra layer of protection and observability when orchestrating game servers on top of Kubernetes.

## Open Source Game Development Summit: Render Graph, a Data-Oriented Approach

**desc**: Cocos engine recently open sourced its data driven Render Graph with a Cyberpunk style demo to showcase high scalability and easy render pipeline customization enabled by this infrastructure. Beyond its original inspiration FrameGraph, RenderGraph uses a data driven approach instead of code driven, it's built with both render pipeline information and render scene information. The novel design is for balancing the convenience and the flexibility of the rendering pipeline customization. It keeps the abilities to automically manage transient resources dependencies and barriers, to visualize and debug the render pipelines. Moreover, RenderGraph manages descriptor set layout automatically, decouples pipeline setup and execution which allows upfront validation, allows graph transformation and modification.In this session Zhenglong ZHOU, Engine Architect at Cocos will explain the core design of this novel RenderGraph technology, and how he used graph theory to construct and transform the render pipeline passes and descriptor set layouts.

**desc**: Every open source project faces some apparent issues: technical ones, like how to organize the development, and financial ones, like how to do a lot with very little and how to promote your project without money.As a project grows, many new, subtler, and tougher challenges arise. How do you promote your project and grow with limited funds? How do you fund your work when users and companies have little incentive to support you financially? How do you stay on track with thousands of contributors who may not share your vision?As people participate freely and willingly in open-source projects, the solutions to scale are unlike traditional companies.Using the Godot game engine as a case study, Nathan Lovato, Founder at GDQuest, will explore the many challenges such a massive project encounters: choosing features, fostering kindness, respect, and inclusivity, funding, promoting a project without funds, and more. For each challenge, this session will look at ways to mitigate those issues.

**desc**: Horizon Forbidden West is Guerrilla's biggest game to date. Keeping up with the rapidly increasing size of the content required significant improvements to our tooling. This talk will explain how we redesigned the asset database and content loading in the Decima engine to scale to millions of files. These new tools are so powerful that it fundamentally changed the way we work with content at scale. By streaming all content from a single server and maintaining metadata of all assets in memory we can make sure our editor, game and other tools remain performant and responsive while working with huge numbers of assets. This led to a solution where we can work on the game without needing to read any files.

## Testing with Building Blocks: A Modular Approach for Quality Assurance

**desc**: With Destiny 2's release cadence, QA faces an interesting challenge to accurately and predictably cost features for testing as well as cover a large testing area in a small period of time! It can be overwhelming for the vast amount of information to be understood and to execute testing against, as well as being able to craft ad hoc plans throughout development.This talk introduces the concept of splitting the functionality of a feature or system to building blocks for users to break down the complexity of testing, help generate ideas to execute through ad hoc sessions, and build confidence of testing with the most value. We then explore strategies to connect the building blocks, build a technical understanding of the systems involved, and save those patterns for future feature development. We'll also be taking a look at examples of how to apply to some of the mechanics found in Destiny's Raids and Dungeons.

These future interfaces intended for immersion present augmented risks for privacy, anonymity, and self determination for users and players, which must be acknowledged while designing applications and games that take advantage of these capabilities. Thinking ahead, incipient neurotechnology applications open the possibility of imagining the future of interfaces in immersive environments, but at the same time, they open even more ethically daunting questions, as in conjunction with design practices and affective computing research, they can be used for invasive, exploitative or manipulative practices. The panel will explore how the current ethical challenges for game development connect with a possible future, through a set of questions and key points.

Now is the time for all game-makers to hit the 'reset' button and take another look at how they acquire, retain and monetize players. Few are taking advantage of solutions already proven in market.For this session, we have assembled a panel of top industry insiders (to be announced soon), each with over 20 years of game-making experience, to provide practical insights into how all game makers can introduce optimal ways to acquire new users, retain them longer, and monetize better than ever. These solutions are already in market but have been long under the radar, with little developer awareness. It's time for the game industry to evolve to a rewarded hybrid business model that can work for any game.

## The Facial Animation Pipeline of 'Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II' (Presented by DI4D)

**desc**: In Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II every main character is a digital double with the same actor providing their likeness, voice performance, body performance and facial performance. This talk will provide a deep dive into the facial scanning, rigging and animation pipeline. Light Stage scans and DI4D PRO 4D expression data of each actor formed the basis for their character's facial rig. This allowed the parameter space coefficients and deformations of the facial rig to be learned with a higher degree of accuracy than from static scans alone. The learned parameter space has sparse semantic meaning, making the rig easy for artists and animators to manipulate when required. Stereo camera HMCs allowed the capture of facial performance to be processed as PURE4D 4D motion data. High quality transfer of the facial motion onto the rig was achieved without any human intervention, making the process highly scalable.

It has long been a core element of game design, and with new natural language models, we will soon see the emergence of more intelligent and dynamic NPCs. But that's just the beginning. Imagine the creative possibilities that could be unlocked as we leverage AI automation. Increased accessibility for players, safer player communities, greater production velocity, dynamic player onboarding, real-time adaptive difficulty, supercharged UGC... AI could be transformative. It could also introduce serious risk and must be handled carefully. Navigating this transition requires a responsible approach to ensure players, processes, and people are protected and set up to thrive. This panel will dive into the role that AI has played in game development historically and examine Microsoft's notion of responsible AI.

**desc**: Stories in games are often delivered alongside gameplay, not through ityet in the player's mind, there is only one "story": the experience of playing the game as a whole. To make our games say things we want, we often lean on linear media storytelling toolbox, and it works. But all games (intently or not) also speak through player actions and the content they operate on, framed by the designers' intent. It's only fitting we develop our design toolset to power this language. This talk aims to explore conceptual foundations for thinking consciously about designing meaningful experiences in games, spoken through gameplay and systems, not only words and pictures.

## Thousands of Soldiers Battle on One Mobile Screen: Applications of Unity's DOTS in 'Return to Empire'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1028877/Thousands-of-Soldiers-Battle-on
**desc**: "Return to Empire" is a 3D massively multiplayer online strategy mobile game developed by TiMi Studio Group. Strategy games often face the demand for large-scale battles with thousands of people on the same screen. At this time, the performance of mobile phones becomes a bottleneck. As a high-quality full 3D strategy mobile game, "Return to Empire" faces even more difficult problems. After continuous research and development iterations, "Return to Empire" based on the application and practice of the Unity DOTS technology stack, finally achieved very good game effects and performance, and established a quality benchmark for SLG mobile games in large-scale battles.We have accumulated rich research and development experience in the practice of DOTS, and have formed a set of effective practical experience for data abstraction, task parallelism, and logic splitting. We looked at how to better leverage multiple CPU cores and decouple them across multiple tasks. We combined with RenderMeshV2 to optimize the rendering. A set of efficient tools has also been accumulated for the workflow of art assets. I believe that these technologies can be very well applied to other games of the same genre, not just SLG games, but also all large-scale computing places. The potential usage scenarios of this technical solution are very broad.

In this session, we will introduce a new, mind-boggling tool-driven technique for revealing the traits and risks of large software systems. Our approach is a comprehensive radiography of the entire system. Besides the static analysis of source code, we also intake the evolution history from the source-control and the issue-tracking systems. When we look at all these together, we identify significant threats that are not directly perceptible in the code, like subtle cross-technology dependencies, components tedious to implement and change, or poor distribution of project knowledge across developers. Over time we examined 200+ systems and about half a billion lines of code. To showcase our approach to software assessment, we will go through the insights we gained while conducting an in-depth review of a gaming company that was mid-journey into becoming a modern technology and data-driven.

For many teams, they're seen as the designer's first line of defense, especially at times when end-player testing is not possible or readily available. Internal playtests can be a great source of continuous feedback but that feedback can be biased. By recognizing this, frameworks can be implemented to help mitigate developer biases and maximize the usefulness of internal playtesting.In this session, Andreia Gonalves, a Senior UX Designer at Full Circle, an Electronic Arts studio, will walk attendees through the framework the skate. development team has applied to their internal playtesting.

## VoRACE: Tools for Automating Dialogue Processing

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1029419/VoRACE-Tools-for-Automating-Dialogue
**desc**: Every year, AAA game companies record hundreds of thousands of dialog lines that bring to life the worlds in their games. Processing these lines is a lengthy process that requires a colossal amount of manual work. VoRACE, or Voice Recording Automating Cleaning Engine, is a set of tools using deep learning to automate the tedious processing of recordings. It accelerates the overall workflow while maintaining the same level of quality. This lecture describes the steps involved in dialogue post-processing along with their challenges and why existing solutions do not apply. It shows how VoRACE automates the various steps in the post-processing pipeline and why it is conceived as computer-assisted creator tools rather than blunt automation modules. Lastly, it presents the implementation, deployment and testing strategy used, and reports the performance of VoRACE in a real-world production setting.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1029231/Web3-Forum-MapleStory-Universe-Perfecting
**desc**: The key to a successful game is simple: give users what they want, and keep giving it to them. Yet the challenge always lies in knowing how; how do companies discern what users truly want, and how do they create a boundless, self-perpetuating platform to continue providing? This session will outline NEXON's answers to those questions through its knowledge of user behavior accumulated over the past 20 years of MapleStory live service. Combined with blockchain technology, MapleStory Universe offers an expansive ecosystem that enables users to fulfill their needs for self-actualization.

## Web3 Forum: Building Great web3 Game Experiences with HyperPlay (Presented by HyperPlay)

**desc**: Web3 gaming is more than secondary markets for in-game items. Diablo 3 had that over a decade ago, and it didn't need a blockchain to accomplish it. nnThis talk will explore web3 game worlds based on principles of interoperability where assets can be permissionlessly carried across the decentralized web and where gaming universes can be extended by the community. nnThis talk will cover how builders can implement this vision using HyperPlay, a web3-native game launcher and aggregator of game stores. HyperPlay allows players to discover and install any game from the Epic Store, GOG, or HyperPlay's own store, and integrates with MetaMask and WalletConnect for simple in-game transactions, even in native desktop games. Both native desktop games and browser games are supported. Developers can implement in-game transactions, and are free from de-platforming and Apple-tax fees.

## Web3 Forum: DAOs for Game Developers (Presented by Dacoco GmbH (Alien Worlds))

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1029018/Web3-Forum-DAOs-for-Game
**desc**: Software development for a blockchain-based dapp/game is all about providing security through decentralisation. This is usually achieved through immutable code in a smart contract. But, as every software dev knows, code will eventually need changes, upgrades and bug fixes. Rather than leaving a security backdoor for software upgrades, we can use the blockchain to host a governing system to control these changes without losing the security provided intrinsically by the blockchain. That system would be a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This session explores the goals and challenges from both technical and human perspectives that contribute to building a successful DAO system and how they are utilised as core game components in the Alien Worlds Metaverse to complement existing NFT game mechanics and mining activities within the game.

Microtransaction and subscription culture takes in billions from gamers each year, but gaming giants continue to insist that these purchases create no real ownership for the player.nnThe Web3 Revolution represents a way to escape from draconian RMT efforts, finally allowing players real ownership over the content they engage with. This next step in the world of mainstream gaming allows a myriad of new possibilities; such as cross-title content, targeted community rewards, and simply more freedom for gamers.nnGaming culture is created in the interaction and dialogue between gamers and developers. It's time to bring those two groups together as equals to make a better future for gaming.

## Web3 Forum: How to Unlock the Multi-billion Dollar Asset Trading Market without Turning Gamers into Gamblers (Presented by Freeverse)

**desc**: The size of the 'grey market' for in-game items - skins, weapons, gold and so on, traded on sites like SkinBaron, Gamerflip, PlayerAuctions - is estimated to be above $40Bn. None of this revenue goes to the game creators. While blockchain technology can legitimize this trading, 2022 showed us that speculating on the price of NFT collectibles in games isn't really much fun - and games, more than anything, should be fun. In this talk, we'll discuss the best ways of unlocking that market, without falling into the trap of speculative NFTs. Permitting in-game items to be legally traded not only gives gamers what they clearly want, but it also increases retention and opens up new long-tail revenue streams for the game itself.

**desc**: Before blockchain, games had been isolated like islands. Gameplay and in-game economy were confined to each island of a game. Blockchain technology expanded the in-game economies beyond the limits of their games. Furthermore, as game tokens and NFTs from games now can be used directly and/or indirectly in other games, the inter-game economy, an economy that connects games, has become a reality. Games and their economies that had existed in numerous individual games are now connected through tokenomics to form a mega-ecosystem. The ultimate question is, what lies in the future of gaming?

## What the F-UX is UX?

In the game industry it can get super hairy; we often gaslight ourselves when reading job descriptions. "Am I a UX/UI designer"? "Why do I need to know code"? "Why the heck does a researcher need to use the Creative Cloud"? Ahh!As a mentor to young UXers, Samus Wolfe wants to help them understand how to land their next gig by understanding what a company is actually looking for vs what they're asking for; it's basically guerilla UX research! How can you curate yourself and your resume to appeal to these jobs even if they don't mention you by name? Samus has some creative and fun ways to make the job hunt in this industry less about the grinding and more about the power leveling! Join them for a light-hearted discussion where everyone can laugh about the goofy parts of the industry, find your next UX nest, and groan together about the inconsistencies we all know exist with "UX" as a title.

With exclusive data and insights from across the industry, hear Patrick make the case that VR gaming is set to explode in a way that most working on flatscreen games are still unprepared for. With the Meta Quest 2 outselling the Xbox Series X/S, those mired in outdated perceptions of VR's niche status are missing not just how big this is already, but the immense potential.

Those who have accumulated the most power (executives, parent companies, etc.) have weaponized legal departments, ERGs, EAPs, among other tools, even co-opting the language of grassroots advocates to neuter the work of culture change and render it largely ineffective. In this talk, Anita Sarkeesian, Executive Director at Feminist Frequency, uses real-world examples from her decade-plus years of experience working with game developers, and highlights the foundational missing pieces to creating real systemic change that supports and uplifts all workers.
