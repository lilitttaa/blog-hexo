## 'Agents of Mayhem': Physically-Based Materials in a Stylized Open World

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024690/-Agents-of-Mayhem-Physically
**desc**: Physically based rendering is the new hot trend for more photorealism in rendering, both real time and pre-rendered, but it doesn't have to be. This talk covers 'Agents of Mayhem', one of a new breed of graphically stylized games using the PBR technique, and covers methods for balancing a full physically based pipeline with a distinct illustrative artistic style. Many things will be covered, including memory management of the additional specular textures, shader techniques, the importance of color choices and use of documentation to maintain the multifaceted style across multiple vendors and artists. The talk is primarily focused on world materials, but lightly touches on the related material stylization of other disciplines.

## 'Gears of War 4', Project Triton: Pre-Computed Environmental Wave Acoustics

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024008/-Gears-of-War-4
**desc**: Project Triton is the first successful effort for detailed scene-dependent wave acoustics in games. Triton will ship in 'Gears of War 4', resulting from a collaboration between The Coalition and Microsoft Research. Triton robustly models complex wave phenomena such as diffraction, scattered reflections and reverberation on static 3D level geometry. In doing so, it captures important effects like smooth occlusion around obstacles or longer reverberation in large halls, as well as how these effects change when source and listener move through the environment. Nikunj and John will discuss both the technical and design aspects of the system, providing details on its integration in Unreal Engine 4 and AudioKinetic Wwise. They will also discuss how interpreting the Triton data forced them to define stylized cinematic and emotional acoustics for 'Gears of War 4' to navigate their way out of an uncanny valley of game audio.

So they add timers, rewards, particles everywhere, collectibles, notifications, and bribes to share content. Your time is valuable but frequently these techniques play on compulsions to obsessively collect, complete, and compete. This isn't necessarily bad per se, but what if you could be just as effective by avoiding or minimizing the use of these methods while appealing to a more intrinsically rewarding player experience? This talk will take a look at the successes and failures of visual design in 'Mini Metro'. It will examine how user interface and visual design decisions play a role in creating a rewarding experience for the player. It will also share how you can support this by building a robust design language, design beauty through a process of elimination, and produce a captivating experience.

## 'Owlboy': The Evolving Art of a 10 Year Project

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024144/-Owlboy-The-Evolving-Art
**desc**: 'Owlboy' has been in development nearly 10 years, outliving an entire console generation. To keep the game relevant, D-Pad Studio has had to re-design the game several times, redraw art assets and spend years and years on polish. The team's number one goal has been to make sure that, despite being a decade old, 'Owlboy' will look like a game worthy of its time.

This talk looks at how, as a developer, to find unique value by doing things that are commonly assumed to be wrong, impossible, or ridiculous. Specific focuses include: How Ludeon Studios defined 'RimWorld' not as a game, but as a story generator, and how forcing themselves into this frame opened up entirely new mechanisms for creating compelling play. How, by strategically leaving out features, they made players engage with features and story elements that aren't actually there. How they made better decisions by not planning despite everyone wanting them to plan. And finally, how they shipped with many seemingly-critical features missing, but nobody cared, because they used a special methodology for selecting features that actually matter instead of the ones that commonly assumed to be necessary.

## 2 Immersive 4 VR: Reinventing 'Rock Band'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024097/2-Immersive-4-VR-Reinventing
**desc**: Developers have spared no processing power in search of immersive "presence", that white whale of VR. However, Harmonix's experience in working on 'Rock Band VR' shows that the immersive flow state induced by action gameplay can actually inhibit "presence"; how can a player feel present in the moment if they're hyper-focused on responding to visually-oriented, millisecond-sensitive gameplay challenges originally designed for flat screens? Thus far, most VR experiences have avoided this paradox by eschewing mechanical depth, but Harmonix believes there are other options. This talk provides a framework for evaluating the trade-offs between mechanical depth and presence while discussing how we reinvented the classic 'Rock Band' franchise in order to resolve this implicit tension in VR by utilizing other sensory channels and somatic cognitive processes.

## 3D Audio in VR: Animation, Mo-Cap and 360 Video

From an audio point of view, this means many more opportunities to provide sonic feedback, including static, moving, reactive, ambient and set-piece audio cues. How does this differ between animated characters / environments, motion capture and 360 live footage? There are many unanswered questions regarding audio implementation for VR. This lecture will go into detail of the process from recording to playback / debugging in the head mounted display. It will touch on aesthetic approaches and implementation tricks learned by the author across multiple VR projects.

**desc**: Everyone generally agrees that entrepreneurship is an important thing, but what does that mean in the context of the business of games and running a studio? Being an entrepreneur means way more than just being willing to do the "business stuff". In many ways, taking entrepreneurship more seriously and adopting advanced techniques will give you a leg up. While nothing can guarantee success, taking a more advanced approach to entrepreneurship will certainly help you avoid shooting yourself in the foot and prevent total disaster. Topics covered will range from leadership skills, funding, studio vision and roadmap, marketing strategies, pitching approach, and mental state. Having invested in over 20 studios, concrete lessons will be shared from backing these entrepreneurial teams.

## Advanced Graphics Tech: "Async Compute: Deep Dive" & "Raster Ordered Views and Conservative Rasterization"

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024731/Advanced-Graphics-Tech-Async-Compute
**desc**: "Async Compute: Deep Dive":Alex Dunn (NVIDIA) and Stephan Hodes (AMD) will discuss how Asynchronous Compute is an important feature of new APIs and an essential know-how for developers using these APIs. In this talk, They'll give a wide range of advice, from high to low level, including case studies, live examples, and overview of available tools, to make a game engine benefit from asynchronous compute. "Raster Ordered Views and Conservative Rasterization":Rahul Sathe (NVIDIA) and Evgeny Makarov (NVIDIA) will discuss how conventional MSAA rasterization can result in a lot of overhead throughout the rendering pipeline. They show how hardware MSAA can be combined with ROVs instead of conventional render targets during rasterization for better AA at reduced cost. They also demonstrate a technique that uses conservative rasterization to place the sample(s) in a fully programmable way. They use raster order views to ensure that pixels along the shared edges of the triangles generated by clipper are handled correctly.

**desc**: "Cinematic Depth of Field":Karl Hillesland (AMD) will explore a solution for high quality yet practical depth of field that leverages compute to overcome some of the previous bottlenecks commonly associated with this technique."Advanced Particles, Fluid and Cloth using DirectX Compute":Hammad Mazhar (NVIDIA) and Richard Tonge (NVIDIA) discuss how particles have many uses, from low to high complexity: non-colliding sparks, shell casings colliding against the ground, particle-particle collision for rigid debris, particle grids for cloth, up to fluid dynamics. Now that Async Compute allows us to utilize otherwise wasted GPU cycles, it is attractive to move more and more of these effects to D3D Compute. Hammad and Richard provide a sequence of successively more complicated D3D compute particle effects. They start from a non-interacting particle system, adding effects until they reach unified debris, cloth and fluid simulation, noting the incremental GPU cost of each.

## Always Be Composing: The Flexible Music System of 'Plants vs. Zombies Heroes'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023974/Always-Be-Composing-The-Flexible
**desc**: The music systems of Plants vs. Zombies evolved over time and are the result of several phases of iteration and reinvention through game development. This talk is an in-depth look at the experiments that shaped these music systems initially, rebuilding the entire score using custom-recorded MIDI sample banks halfway through, and continuing to tighten the link between music and gameplay all the way up until the game's release.The guiding principle for the music of PvZ: Heroes was to support the gameplay first and foremost. We wanted music to dynamically track gameplay more closely than previous PvZ games, and switching genres meant room for some fairly big stylistic departures. Extensive prototyping eventually led to a "Saturday morning cartoon" vibe with exciting music and systems being created making the game feel punchier and more alive.

Oddly, moving into leadership means re-rolling your profession. He learned that you need to acquire a complete new skill set that is social in nature. It is so predominant that handling social interactions well will have more of an impact than being a good artist, and there are things you'll figure out the hard way. Going through that process, Denis made notes every time he screwed something up or when things went better than expected. He ended up distilling 9 things that were major hints that he learned from his experience. All of them are not art related but made his work so much easier, that he considers them essential to run an art team.

He will explain how audio implementation changed dramatically over the last 12 years and list how audio middlewares are now based on the similar data-driven concepts, which shift responsibility and ownership from the implementers more towards the content providers. These changes make it easier to understand the basic technical functionality in use and to take advantage by organizing assets, iterating, and debugging."Interactive Music Approaches":This talk will focus on some strategies and design approaches for creating interactive music systems that help promote the game's narrative through music.

**desc**: Audio for virtual reality (VR) presents a significant array of challenges and augmentations to the traditional requirements of sound designers employed within the video game industry. The change in perspective and embodiment of the player requires the employment of additional software tools and consideration of object size, spacing and spatial design as a more significant part of the sound design process. This session will discuss approaching these tasks from the perspective of developing audio for all scales of interactive VR applications. Focusing on the design considerations and processes required in this unique medium, the content of this presentation is designed to give insight into the complexity of designing for this new medium, and potential pipeline and work flow approaches.

Traditionally, "sound sets" used for of injury and fight sounds contained a "variety pack" to avoid tiring the player's ear with repetition. As combat animations become increasingly bespoke real-time renders that are customized to match a player's input, conveying accurate VO feedback is ever more essential. Khris will discuss her recent approach to improving fight mechanic comprehension while the player is in the heat of battle.

But it's everywhere; in your character development, in your resource management, in your card-collecting, and it's important to get it right, because ultimately it can end up dictating how people play your game. In this talk, Matt Woodward ('Albion Online', 'EVE Online') will explain how Sandbox Interactive goes about balancing the economy in 'Albion', a market-driven MMO. Starting right at the top, with "why care about economy balance?", he will step through the entire process from start to finish, explaining balance anchors, core balance relationships, and constraint-driven design, using real examples from 'Albion' to illustrate each stage.

**desc**: While Moore's Law continues to faithfully bestow more processing power on us, the demand for increasingly more complex game systems continues to leave little time for extended AI processing. Unfortunately, exceeding the AI's designated time slice by even a small amount can lower a game's framerate, rendering many potentially useful AI techniques impractical. This talk describes how to implement an asynchronous task processing system which can smooth CPU spikes, leverage idle cores, and guarantee an exact processing time limit for their AI step allowing programmers to still use complex and long-running AI computation in a real-time video game without compromising simulation quality.

Last Fall, Riot Games (known for the video game, 'League of Legends') launched the cooperative board game 'Mechs vs. Minions'. Rather than license out their IP to an established partner, Riot spent years developing the game entirely in-house with a team that leaned more on their moxie than any tabletop experience. Join Product Owner Chris Cantrell as he chats candidly about the development of 'Mechs vs. Minions', what internal and external hurdles they discovered along the way, and the terror and pressures that come with a skeleton crew "kickstarting" a game within a company where nobody expected it.

This session covers the design process behind 'Puzzle Strike'. What were its design goals? How did it go about achieving them? 'Puzzle Strike' tackled problems such as eliminating lame duck (players still in the game who can't win anymore), reducing pre-game collusion of doubling up on opponents, building exciting moments into the system, and more. It was unusually difficult to balance, even as asymmetric games go, because its systems are so overlapping and interconnected. It took years to discover some changes that were needed for its core systems, but you can learn all that in just 30 minutes.

In other words, the negative emotions from losing $100 are stronger than the positive emotions from gaining $100; about twice as strong according to a variety of experiments. The fundamental aspect of loss aversion to human psychology is very deep, and touches a wide variety of phenomenon, most of which are directly relevant to game design. This talk from veteran tabletop game designer Geoff Engelstein ('Space Cadets') examines board games and other relevant game-like experiences to explore framing, regret, competence, and other effects, and their relation to players' relationship with the game experience.

The fundamental aspect of loss aversion to human psychology is very deep, and touches a wide variety of phenomenon, most of which are directly relevant to game design. This talk from veteran tabletop game designer Geoff Engelstein ('Space Cadets') examines board games and other relevant game-like experiences to explore framing, regret, competence, and other effects, and their relation to players' relationship with the game experience.

## Board Game Design Day: Design Epiphanies from 'Qwirkle' and Other Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024257/Board-Game-Design-Day-Design
**desc**: Design epiphanies are those thrilling moments when you fully grasp a design concept that can inform all of your work, not just your current project. Sometimes an epiphany is fairly obvious, but you understand a design concept in a more experiential way than you previously understood it. Sometimes an epiphany helps you realize something about game design that you would have never recognized before. And sometimes an epiphany can become a guiding principle for your future games. Susan McKinley Ross is an award-winning toy and game designer best known for designing the board game, 'Qwirkle'. Her personal design epiphanies range from the simple to the specific and they've helped her through the design process for numerous products, including 12 board games. Susan will discuss the design epiphanies that have most influenced her work and she'll give examples of how these insights affected the final versions of her games, including 'Qwirkle'.

To achieve the desired feel, the combat AI in 'DOOM' relies heavily on straightforward full body animations. However, this meant that the AI animation controls needed to be more robust and flexible than simple naive playback. This lecture explains some of the techniques that were used to make this approach feasible in a modern game environment as dynamic as the critically acclaimed combat of 'DOOM'.

## Building Game Mechanics to Elevate Narrative in 'Oxenfree'

**desc**: When Night School set out to create their debut game, 'Oxenfree', they had one goal in mind: merge storytelling and mechanics as closely as possible. Throughout development, the developers constantly evaluated 'Oxenfree' through the lens of two critical questions: "Why is the player playing this?" and "What is the player doing while we have them?" In Night School's game, the "why" is the player defining Alex's story, and the "what" is a set of mechanics built to make interacting with the story feel personal and novel. This talk, from 'Oxenfree' co-creator Sean Krankel, will dive into the various design decisions that went into creating an acclaimed supernatural thriller rooted in communication and exploration.

## Can You See Me Now? Building Robust AI Sensory Systems

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1026497/Can-You-See-Me-Now
**desc**: Much of the credibility in action/adventure games comes from the ability of NPCs to properly detect the player and its actions in the world. If the NPC detects things that it shouldn't or misses obvious stimuli, immersion and even entire gameplay systems may be broken. What is needed is a robust, designer-configurable sensory system to provide believable detection and reactions from game agents. Drawing on work from the 'Assassin's Creed' and 'Thief' franchises, this session describes how to construct advanced sensory systems to provide gameplay depth for the player. The presentation focuses mostly on visual detection but also covers audio detection.

**desc**: The care and planning you put into shutting down your game's community will directly affect the legacy of the game and that of your overall brand. In this presentation, Chloe will explain best practices that will ensure your community walks away feeling they've been treated with respect and gives them the best goodbye possible. Chloe will walk you through how to lay the groundwork with a solid schedule and messaging plan so that you and your community can part ways on good terms. That way, when you run into each other again, you can both feel good about it.

## Cozmo: Animation Pipeline for a Physical Robot

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024488/Cozmo-Animation-Pipeline-for-a
**desc**: In order to make animations interesting and appealing, 3D animators often use principles such as squash-and-stretch or follow-through, pushing the model and the rig to do deformations that would be impossible in the real world. For Cozmo, Anki used real world physics so there was no "cheating", and they had to adjust their way of thinking about assets accordingly. This session presents an overview of the asset pipeline on Cozmo, a complex, physical, game-playing robot, with over 300 parts, powered by a mobile app. This session will also describe the complexities of using data from Maya to transfer animation onto something with physical constraints. Molly and Daria from Anki will discuss the tools built for fast animator iteration, scripts for testing, debugging, how it eventually translates to physical movement and other workflow improvements throughout the development cycle. They will review the process for streaming audio and animation data to the robot and when programmatic corrections were required.

Previous games focused on describing a world through elegant prose, but the next project will be a 3D adventure. This talk introduces the concept of an "interactive film script", using inkle's open source narrative scripting language, Ink. As a development philosophy, taking a script-first approach promotes narrative pacing and continuity as a primary goal in development. How can ink, a text-based format, be used within a freely explorable 3D scene? This presentation will demonstrate with practical examples how entire scenes of flexible dialog can be written and tested in isolation, before they're easily imported into Unity to be played with no modification.

Now that Async Compute allows us to utilize otherwise wasted GPU cycles, it is attractive to move more of these effects to D3D Compute.We provide a sequence of successively more complicated D3D compute particle effects. We start from a non-interacting particle system, adding effects until we reach unified debris, cloth and fluid simulation, noting the incremental GPU cost of each.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024453/Data-Binding-Architectures-for-Rapid
**desc**: Modern application development architectures often use user interface patterns like Model-View-Controller and Model-View-ViewModel, which provide a clear structure for both developer and artist workflows, and direct support in the IDE. However, the current status quo in mobile game development utilizes engines like Unity3D which do not have native support for similar workflows. This results in a more error-prone and redundant user interface development workflow, where artists create a user interface remotely and developers have to mimic it in the engine. This talk shows how to apply modern development architectures to Unity3D, allowing developers and artists to focus each on their expertise and still have the results align in harmony. By applying proven concepts, these modern developments allow each party to work independently while still being able to test their own work at all times.

## Data Driven Granular Synthesis for Video Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023987/Data-Driven-Granular-Synthesis-for
**desc**: Square Enix proposes a novel system that automatically extracts features from existing recordings of granular sounds, like the sound of rain, the sound of running water or the sound of falling debris. Based on the extracted data a similar sound can be reproduced. A few seconds of recorded audio data provide enough information to create similar sounds of high quality and arbitrary length. By varying the parameters of the resynthesis sound designers can tweak the sound to their liking. In this talk they want to explain the implementation of the system and then go on and talk about its integration in the workflow of game production. They are also going to explain for what sounds the system can be used. Comparisons to classic sample playback will show that they can reduce the necessary memory by up to 90% without compromising on quality. They will also demonstrate in which way sound designers can tweak the sound by changing synthesis parameters.

## Deterministic vs. Replicated AI: Building the Battlefield of 'For Honor'

This lecture will cover how, on one side, the team at Ubisoft created a believable large scale battlefield on the backbone of a distributed peer-to-peer deterministic simulation: dozens of interactive actors, all perfectly synchronized between peers with no network traffic. This session will show how this was achieved, from the importance of metadata built in the world, to levers given to designers to control many actors, including building complex and interesting behaviors by using simple but elegant rules. This lecture will also show how, on the other side, no battlefield is complete without heroic warriors; opponents worthy of the skills of a player. With requirements ranging from high-level objectives to reactive decision-making, including environmental awareness, those deep and challenging AIs required their own pipeline: a replicated decision system, using extracted data from Ubisoft's fight logic, tools to empower the AI designers, and automated testing to validate design intentions.

## Efficient Texture Streaming in 'Titanfall 2'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024418/Efficient-Texture-Streaming-in-Titanfall
**desc**: In developing 'Titanfall 2', Respawn wanted more detailed environments, but also a lot more options for player weapons, equipment and titans. One key was adding real-time texture streaming to their engine. However, with little GPU or CPU to spare, they needed an approach that could rely on offline processing. It had to allow artists the freedom to create textures at whatever resolution they want, without having to do much manual setup or tweaking. Finally, for PC, Respawn's team had to work with different amounts of RAM and display resolutions. This session will go into depth about their approach, including their preprocess, how they stream in precomputed data to drive their streaming, their pipeline, how they use histograms to prioritize textures to load or drop, as well as useful tools and lessons learned.

**desc**: Genuinely new and innovative technologies don't come along very often but when they do, they're highly disruptive. Blockchains are a new and poorly understood technology, popularized by Bitcoin, which have the capacity to enable fundamental changes in the game industry. This isn't just talk of a potential future; a number of developers and tool providers are already successfully using blockchains in their projects, including for fundraising purposes. Initially, the audience will learn the basics of blockchains, subsequently proceeding to explore projects of the past, present and future of relevance to the game industry. The session includes coverage of currencies, fundraising and virtual property along with a discussion on what the future may hold for innovative business models throughout the game sector.

## Epic AND Interactive Music in 'Final Fantasy XV'

**desc**: Interactive music is common in AAA games, but in games like 'Final Fantasy' that always have a strong melody line and musical progression, it doesn't go well in the same way. Square Enix worked to make an intelligent music system called "MAGI", that allows composers to create music in any tempo or measures and has customized sync points to make it interactive while remaining epic. In this talk, the sound team behind 'Final Fantasy XV' will share how they created actual music data in their proprietary authoring tools, and issues they faced during implementing them such as synchronization with game scene and looping, fading, etc.

## Fast, Cheap and Flashy: An Indie Art Direction Adventure

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023958/Fast-Cheap-and-Flashy-An
**desc**: 'Tooth & Tail', Pocketwatch Games' follow-up to 'Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine', had been in development for nearly two years, but the art was in trouble. It was inconsistent, hard to read, and a little dull. The style needed to be redesigned and ushered through production but there was a catch: it needed to ship in ten months and it couldn't cost a lot. Lateral thinking, semi-unconventional pipelines, educated-risk taking, and old-fashioned art fundamentals came to the rescue, and helped reshape the game's style into something that won awards before the game was even released. But what's the cost of succeeding early, and what happens when a team that worked so long with a big, stressful long term goal suddenly doesn't have one? The examples are pixelated, but the lessons are universal.

## Friendship, Curiosity & Challenge: Focusing Your Career as an Indie Dev

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024252/Friendship-Curiosity-Challenge-Focusing-Your
**desc**: Being an indie developer means you have a sometimes overwhelming amount of freedom to decide what projects you work on, who you work with, what conferences you go to, which new features to add to your current game and so on. Jenn Sandercock discovered that, just like a game jam theme, a set of constraints can guide both a game's development and your overall career as an indie developer. Based off the gameplay experiences she was aiming to develop, Jenn created her personal mission statement to foster friendship, curiosity and challenge. In this talk, Jenn will go over how she came to define these qualities, how they have impacted her at different moments in her journey and how they focus her career. She will also give the audience an understanding of how to do it themselves.

## From Rational to Emotional: Designs that Increase Player Retention

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024153/From-Rational-to-Emotional-Designs
**desc**: Humans aren't always as rational as they might think. They are subjective thinkers who are driven by powerful, and often misunderstood, emotions. This talk will dissect the basic emotions that drive everyone, and provide specific examples of design techniques that encourage the formation of enduring emotional ties that could enhance both retention and enjoyment for players. This is NOT a talk about narrative design or "how to make people cry", but an evaluation of the underlying factors that can create emotional attachment, and how to encourage those connections in games with focused design and UX techniques.

## From Shore to Horizon: Creating a Practical Tessellation Based Solution

**desc**: LABS is a research and development team that operates out of Eidos-Montral. Their goal is to look into technologies which can help to distinguish SEW's studios, and its products, amongst the rest. Based on some good intuition and heavy prototyping, the team develops forward looking technologies, ensuring that they meet the industry's needs both now and in the future. LABS worked with Io-Interactive for a little over a year on 3 unique graphics features, including a complete Ocean Technology system. This is a practical tessellation-based ocean surface solution. This implementation offers believable surface deformation, a camera-to-horizon visibility distance, and intrinsic geometry degradation (level of detail). The primary goal is to offer a practical solution that can be easily implemented, that will fit an arbitrary coastline, and that can support the aforementioned features with a relatively low performance footprint.

**desc**: VR is a game changer when it comes to immersion. But as a new medium, VR also comes with new challenges. One of them is potential discomfort caused by virtual motion. We could not imagine VR being limited to static or "teleportation" experiences, so we began an R&D project aimed at finding a way to allow comfortable high-speed motion in VR. We will describe this research (e.g. effects of motion in peripheral vision), and solutions we found (e.g. dynamic peripheral vision blinders). We also looked for controls that would not only be comfortable, but also very intuitive and precise. The results surpassed our expectations, achieving incredibly precise and reactive controls!

This session will detail the display mapping used to implement the"grade once, output many" approach to targeting any display and why an ad-hoc approach as opposed to filmic tone mapping was chosen. Frostbite retained 3D LUT-based grading flexibility and the accuracy differences of computing these in decorrelated color spaces will be shown. This session will also include the main issues found on early adopter games, differences between HDR standards, optimizations to achieve performance parity with the legacy path and why supporting HDR can also improve the SDR version.

## Higher Res Without Sacrificing Quality, plus Other Lessons from 'PlayStation VR Worlds'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024476/Higher-Res-Without-Sacrificing-Quality
**desc**: Rendering for VR puts a premium on efficiency and reliability, as failure to render each eye's image in 8.3 milliseconds causes stuttering and risks nausea for the player. This talk goes into detail on the numerous low-level and high-level optimizations implemented to achieve this for 'PlayStation VR Worlds', a title that targeted state of the art graphical techniques and VR-leading visuals. Although the work targeted VR on PlayStation, most of the findings are relevant to non-VR games and indeed other platforms. As the graphics team was small (3 programmers), the team needed to minimize the time spent on crashes, glitches and performance issues. The talk will also describe some of the low-level tricks used to limit this wasted time, using run-time validation, CPU-side shader debugging and performance profiling.

## How (and When) to Not Give up on Your Game

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024402/How-(and-When)-to-Not
**desc**: Normally, when you release a game, you do a bit of PR for it, it sells or it doesn't, and then you move on. But at Necrosoft Games they believe that if you have a game out, you can sell it again, be that to different platform holders, different regions, or even through a different model. And it's not just them, they've got testimonies from other developers who also sell their games multiple times, through multiple channels. But this title has two meanings, there are often points in development when you feel like you should scrap your game, and start something new. Sometimes this is the right move. Other times, by stepping back and returning to a project later, you'll make it stronger than ever. Your games have value, Necrosoft wants to help you make the most of them.

## How Design Can Ensure Impartial Scientific Fairness in User Research

Yet, time and again, those at Microsoft Studios User Research meet designers who are intimidated by the process, unsure how to take advantage of what they can deliver, or uncertain how to ensure that the tests that are run are fair (both to the user but also the designer). It can be hard for someone not versed in the design principles of science to understand what is high quality research, and what merely uses the patina of methods to garner persuasiveness. This talk will clarify that distinction by laying out the design principles that shape good research, explaining what URs need most from designers, and detailing some simple checks a designer can request to ensure they receive the highest quality user research.

With the cloud storage, fiber internet, 4G LTE, smartphones, cellular modems and ubiquitous wifi, working remotely is increasingly an option for anyone to achieve at any level of seniority... technically. But what skills and disciplines are necessary to transition from a full-time office worker into someone that works from home, a coffee shop, or the road? It's a lot more than simply VPNing in, syncing to latest from your team's source control, and checking email twice a day. Establishing a persistent, reliable remote presence that attracts and retains clients demands a very particular skillset. If you're wondering how to transition into working from home for your full-time job, wanting to hone your skills as a project manager utilizing remote teams, or even if you're thinking of striking out on your own and going indie, come listen!

It was a big task in the production, and one with much uncertainty. It took several years and several people to get it standing on its feet, but it was no calculated effort. In the years it was being made, a third of the company worked on, or rather jammed on it. Everyone involved added their own expertise, without order, as a sort of hive mind making hive mind. The team at Playdead will peel apart the layers they've woven together, exposing dynamic arms imposed on a sack of physics bodies, moved by physics and animation as one, and glued together by shading. Through all the details, they'll show how an unstable, decentralized collaboration can lead to an unexpectedly whole and alive creature, albeit chaotic.

In a discussion of his work on the psychological thriller game 'Get Even', published by Bandai Namco, Olivier Deriviere will demonstrate how he used his music to create a visceral and emotional journey.

## Inviting Player Creativity Through Game Mechanics

**desc**: How can games help players act creatively? How can game designers use the structure of their games to get someone creating pictures, building landscapes, writing poems, composing music? This talk provides an overview of a dozen different techniques that games can use to encourage player creativity, from encouraging people indirectly through adding constraints, to mediating collaborations, to distracting them from the fact that they're being asked to make something at all. It looks at the strengths and pitfalls of each technique, and examples where it's been used in existing games. It also draws on the wider realm of analogue games and participatory and interactive arts practices, and their use of play and game to prompt creative acts.

## Level Design Workshop: A Narrative Approach to Level Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024601/Level-Design-Workshop-A-Narrative
**desc**: Levels are the spaces in which the player experiences the events of a game's narrative. In games where narrative is a primary focus, it becomes necessary to shape these spaces in such a way that the story's setting and pace are taken into account. Story creates the backbone of a level, and often the entire game. As levels are developed and tuned, storytelling is prioritized alongside gameplay "feel" to create a cohesive narrative experience. An understanding of narrative gives a level designer a guide for everything from the pace of their level to an understanding for which assets should be placed where. Familiarizing oneself with storytelling techniques and how they can be utilized to evoke a desired feeling from the player is an indispensable aspect of level design. As in other media such as movies, evoking feeling from a player successfully is what makes a game a memorable experience.

For example, the first chapter features slices of life that go from coding to testing a game to checking social media and getting harassed, to finally meditating to come back down. Each of these games/levels on their own is a specific kind of experience, but in this order, you begin to see the perspective of the phone's owner as the player performs as them.

For a composer to remain viable and grow as an artist, they need to continually research new music, stay on top of technology, and be inspired and energized by new ideas. In addition, they must make time for industry events to meet new potential collaborators and stay in touch with their peers. Veteran game composer, Tom Salta, along with a panel of other award winning composers will share their insights and wisdom on how they aim to strike a balance between their professional and personal lives. This topic is rarely, if ever, spoken about publicly but yet it is, perhaps, one of the most important aspects for any composer to manage if they want to have a productive and fulfilling long-term career.

## Linking Students to the Right Games Industry Scholarships and Mentorships

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024161/Linking-Students-to-the-Right
**desc**: The games industry has multiple scholarships and mentorships for students planning a career in interactive entertainment. How can faculty and administrators help their students earn more of these opportunities? Many qualified students don't know about even well-publicized programs, and students who do apply often make critical mistakes in their submissions. Some programs that give no cash awards may actually have the greatest positive impact on a student's career. In this short talk Don Daglow, President of the AIAS Foundation, will share tips for faculty to share with students on finding and applying for scholarships and mentorships, and mistakes to avoid.

## Making Diversity and Inclusion Work

**desc**: There are several programs, courses, and initiatives that can be created to implement diversity and inclusion in the industry today. Researchers and vendors have put in a wealth of resources to discover the best ways to hire and develop underrepresented groups. So why is the industry still struggling? The short answer is that diversity and inclusion are not formulaic. It's a process that stretches over time to shift and evolve a company's culture. It can't be solved with training sessions because it's an active mindset, not an afterthought or checkbox. At the end of her first 90 days as a Manager of Diversity & Inclusion Programs at Riot Games, Soha didn't have a concrete action plan for how to solve issues within this space. Instead, she implemented key values to frame how she can approach diversity in order to make it authentic, valuable, and an integral part of a company.

B-rep is efficient both in traversal times, storage requirements, and ease of serialization. Boundary traversals needed for cutting operations or silhouette computation are fast since they avoid the use of a modulo-3 operation. This presentation will show code for common operations on this structure then conclude with an improvement to Quickhull convex hull construction which increases its speed threefold.

Mean value coordinates are a generalization of Barycentric coordinates which allow a vertex in a planar triangulation to be expressed as a convex combination of its neighbors. Harmonic functions are twice-continuously differentiable over a manifold, useful when texturing complex meshes of unknown topology and genus with surface details (rust, cracks). Nicholas will go over how he constructs them by discretizing the Laplace operator using cotangent weights, then solving a constrained least-squares optimization.

Although he will walk through his specific solution, the solution itself isn't the point. He'll walk through his whole process from figuring out what the problem actually was, to researching a couple of finer math points, to optimizing the final result. It's a case study in process rather than a particular solution. He'll cover the initial data analysis to figure out the problem (and all the dead ends I went down that didn't produce fruit) and the various strategies for solving (and rediscovering some of the finer points of Knuth's work). Concretely, he'll also provide math background on polynomials, galois fields, polynomial factorization and the Berlekamp algorithm. He'll tie specific processes or approaches to other problems others are likely to encounter in games and tools (e.g. CRC) to ensure it's relevancy and to keep it from being just some solution to some random puzzle.

## Modify Everything! Data-Driven Dynamic Gameplay Effects on 'For Honor'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024580/Modify-Everything-Data-Driven-Dynamic
**desc**: Ubisoft's 'For Honor' grew from a production culture of "gameplay first" and "fail faster", promoting quick iteration times and flexibility. In keeping with those values, Ubisoft developed the modifiers system, a data-driven system that allows designers to dynamically create gameplay effects. It can handle anything from simply buffing/debuffing character stats (damage, speed, etc.) to affecting AI decision-making, launching areas of effects, and adding attack properties. This talk will dive into the inner workings of the system, and what makes it maintainable in code yet very powerful in data. It will also go over what problems they encountered and the concrete solutions they used to solve them.

## More Than MIDI: Working with Live Musicians as an Indie

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024621/More-Than-MIDI-Working-with
**desc**: Hiring live musicians is the perfect way to elevate your soundtrack. Real performers bring warmth, expression, and a human element that synths and samplers can't always match. Yet, for an indie game composer, there are a lot of obstacles to working with live talent. Where will the money come from? How can you effectively manage other musicians, especially if you've never done it before? If you hire new creative minds, will you lose the unique identity that makes your work stand out? Indie composers Ryan Ike ('Where the Water Tastes Like Wine') and Jacob Pernell ('Failsafe') invite you to join them as they discuss the ins-and-outs of working with live performers. They'll cover everything from building relationships with musicians, to allowing your players to be expressive in a way that adds to your work without overriding it, to paying your performers without going broke yourself.

## Motion Warping in 'Gears of War 4': Doing More with Less

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024219/Motion-Warping-in-Gears-of
**desc**: The sheer magnitude of animation assets needed to build smooth and realistic movement systems while keeping a character grounded in an uneven and dynamic environment has changed how animation behaviors are built and authored. Blending multiple animations has traditionally been a way of dealing with distance, direction and environmental variance. However, the amount of assets needed for adequate coverage in today's large AAA titles can be crushing. Multiple animation blending also reduces visual freedom as blended animations must be of similar style and timing. Some games have tackled this content explosion by dynamically warping motion to meet the spatial constraints. These are often ad hoc/specific to particular actions and not exposed to the animator. For 'Gears of War 4', The Coalition developed a generalized solution by introducing the concept of warp points.

Players explore freely, encountering narrative content in any order and creating hundreds of small and large scale consequences, all of which are persistent. With the game rendered entirely through prose text, continuity is critical to ensuring believability, and in this talk Jon will outline how inkle Ltd designed and scripted the game to work in an ad-hoc fashion, using defensive logic to ensure the story gets told and makes sense regardless of how it comes about. He'll illustrate with concrete examples from Sorcery!'s later parts, '80 Days', and their upcoming title, and discuss some of the resulting challenges.

This talk describes the features of the language and why they were chosen, and it explores how prediction and replication of script behavior is automated so that common networking problems are handled for the scripter. This approach to synchronizing fast-paced gameplay over variable-quality networks comes with both benefits and challenges. A variety of networking topics are discussed in this talk, including responsiveness, security, bandwidth usage, seamlessness, and ease of implementation. Statescript addresses each of these concerns, providing designers with a flexible, iterative workflow in which new heroes can quickly be taken from prototype to shippable with little to no new code.

## Our Games Are Not Linear, So Why Are Our Careers?

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024047/Our-Games-Are-Not-Linear
**desc**: The games industry is faster changing than most other industries and so your approach to your career needs to be flexible to reflect that. The traditional model for a career is a path that you progress down, improving and being promoted, but this is an old concept, based on stable industries that don't have a lot of disruption. Instead you can collect skills and experiences, often through lateral and sometimes backwards movement to keep adding to your skillset, to be able to react to a changing market and build a future-proof career. This session is going to look at the idea of a Career Lattice as an alternative theory of career progression. The session will present the theory of the Career Lattice, showing case studies of non-linear careers. Often the eventual directions were unexpected, but people took opportunities that were available because of their flexible and transferable skillset. This is often talked about as "they got lucky".

## Procedural Narrative Generation

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024143/Procedural-Narrative
**desc**: As storytelling becomes more central to modern games, writers must increasingly contend with the tension between permitting player autonomy and maintaining the beats of a handcrafted narrative arc. Procedural narrative generation offers computational techniques to address this challenge. Decades of research have brought about techniques such as social simulation, drama management, and data recombination, which can be used to create more believable non-player characters, provide players with more narrative agency, and extend story possibilities beyond the author's imagination. We survey this research and present the tools available to the modern-day game designer, while also identifying gaps between theory and practice.

What will make your game successful is uncertain, what your team can accomplish is unknown, and whether your new feature is good or not is hard to measure. But as a producer, you have to make it work and guide your project to a successful release. This talk will cover what ambiguity is and what causes it, ways you can tell whether it's a problem that needs to be fixed or a situation that needs to be accepted, and what you as a producer can do to fix the problems and avoid the chaos and anxiety that can result from uncertain goals and lack of information.

**desc**: As game development evolves so does the role that production plays in the creation of the modern video game. New roles, and new types of games, require new skills, new tools and new methodologies. And also the flexibility to work with current systems when you join an established team. In this talk, Caryl Shaw will review the many different producer-adjacent roles that exist today, development directors, product managers, outsourcing producers, program managers, etc.; roles that require similar skills as a traditional production job, but also demand and compliment other areas of expertise someone might be bringing to the table. These different roles are often appropriate paths for producers to take who want to expand their scope of influence on a project. Additionally, this talk will talk about how some of these roles change and shift when moving from small teams to large teams and how different organizational methods can contribute to a successful product, either when you are building out a new team or transitioning into one with an established culture.

While these mechanics of game production are indeed important, there's another critical facet that has been explored far less: the emotional and nebulous portion of being a producer. In order to maintain the health of a project, producers must react to team dynamics, and adjust things on the fly. Once processes are in place, the producer must have their finger firmly on the pulse of the team and be able to diagnose situations that often call for drastically different solutions. In this session the speakers will investigate several facets of soft skills and share specific situations that they have encountered throughout their careers and how their soft skills have saved the team and shipped awesome games. Topics include conflict in the workplace, building team culture, team morale, and being the heart of the team.

Through an experimental and exploratory demo process, the game's score pointed towards the creation of an interactive, all-original blues score. The blues, however, introduces several challenges: its form and structure is very simple, its instrumentation is limited in color, and often its players, while accomplished, are not musically literate. This talk will address the challenges of working with a music tradition that is not typically used for scoring video games. The talk will address creating concept demos for an alternative ensemble, overcoming scoring and orchestration issues, how to produce efficient recording sessions with alternative methods of communicating with players who improvise or don't read music, how to respect the integrity of a music tradition while stretching its boundaries, and how to technically and creatively work improvisation into a dynamic scoring system.

## Rising Tides: Stories in Audio Mentorship and Community (a Microtalk)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1023969/Rising-Tides-Stories-in-Audio
**desc**: The game audio community seems to (almost) universally share the compulsion to advise and help newcomers because someone has usually done the same for them. Where this becomes interesting is in the different stories that game audio professionals all have. Every single one is different. This session will give the audience 10 unique stories on game audio mentorship and community. In the classic GDC microtalk model, each speaker has 5 minutes and 20 seconds to go through their 20 slides (each timed at 16 seconds apiece). The ideas will flick by like paint from a spin art turntable, but aim to splatter the audience with colorful, inspired tales on the spirit of volunteerism and mentorship.

## Rules of the Game: Another Five Techniques from Particularly Crafty Designers

**desc**: Ever wonder what specific design rules went into making some of your favorite games? Game design may be a fluid art without hard and fast rules, but it is still fascinating to find what unique techniques specific designers use and see how those rules help them make great games. "Rules of the Game" returns for GDC 2017 to showcase five more experienced designers and some of their personal design tricks-of-the-trade. Each speaker has ten minutes to go into detail about their rule and talk about how they've used it on past projects, highlighting where it works well and where it may not be applicable. For each rule, you can then decide whether it's useful for your own projects and how you might merge that technique into your own design rulebook. You may not agree with every rule you hear in this fast-paced and energetic session, but they'll certainly get you thinking about the craft of game design.

## Selling Out: What a Year of F2P Taught an Art-House Indie

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024246/Selling-Out-What-a-Year
**desc**: What does the transition from deep art-house (city-scale real-world adventures; collaborations with choreographers; interactive dialogues about death) to highly commercial F2P do to a game designer? Is it selling out? Or finally becoming a 'real' game designer? Are there any transferable skills between the two design spaces? Is one kind of design fundamentally more rewarding? Is it a one-way door, or should we be looking for more cross-pollination between these spheres? As a member of Hide&Seek, Margaret Robertson used to make games that tackled bereavement, drove real-world space discovery and made artworks out of drinks coasters. Now, as Game Director at PlayDots, she maximizes the design and business potential of a grid of dots. This session reveals some surprising truths about design practice, business priorities, and career satisfaction in the course of that shift.

This interactive session will help you collaborate better by more candidly conducting difficult conversations. You will: reflect on how you relate to conflict, your organization's culture around conflict, and how conflict might be useful; experience how a healthy mix of assertion and cooperation leads to true collaboration; and learn how emotional intelligence can help anyone better navigate difficult conversations.

A true competitive advantage is one that cannot be easily replicated by other companies. It's not just about what you do. It's about what you don't do. Selectively choosing its activities allowed Southwest Airlines to punch above its weight-class. It allowed Ikea to maximize profitability without sacrificing quality. And it allowed an ostensibly niche title like 'Dark Souls' to become an industry power-house. In this session, producer and consultant Justin Fischer will show you the framework for establishing your own competitive advantage. Using both strategic theory and practical examples, Justin will show you how to tailor your design choices to make target audiences more profitable and your success harder to imitate.

## Study Abroad: The Missing Piece in Undergraduate Games Education?

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024138/Study-Abroad-The-Missing-Piece
**desc**: Today's game design students enter an increasingly international market for both games and employees, but often lack skills in navigating cultural and linguistic differences. Study abroad is one of the most effective ways to give students those critical intercultural skills, but very few game-specific study abroad opportunities currently exist. RIT has developed several programs specifically for game design students. Elizabeth Lawley will discuss RIT's experiences in developing these programs, and the benefits that students gain from them, and offer suggestions as to how faculty at other universities can begin to implement similar partnerships with international campuses.

Often the goal is to design a purely neutral system, completely free of bias, but since no one is free of bias, is that realistic? Instead of striving for neutrality, the first step to truly affecting game design is to realize that nothing is neutral: what is seen as a lack of bias is one's own blindness to the circumstances one lives within. In this session, Elizabeth Sampat discusses the 'SimCity' franchise and its politics, and how design decisions both deliberate and unconscious make statements about how the world works, and how you can use the knowledge of your own biases and philosophies to make more compelling, coherent games.

## The Casual (but Regal) Swipe: Creating Game Mechanics in 'Reigns'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024412/The-Casual-(but-Regal)-Swipe
**desc**: The development and writing of the "year by year" strategy game, 'Reigns', explored the potential of its core system, the swiping mechanic " la tinder". In this talk, 'Reigns' co-creator Francois Alliott explains how the team gave themselves a set of constraints defined by the gameplay they were exploring and the tone they wanted to give to the game. But these rules never dictated the writing of the game or the extent of what the game could be. Bifurcation and wandering were essential to write both the code and the content of 'Reigns' throughout the 6 months of its production. This sort of approach, although apparently messy and unstructured, is very powerful, especially for indies. Alliot believes that the industry is at the point where game development could almost be considered as accessible as writing, because the tools are less of an obstacle, and explains in this GDC talk how creators can use the same skills as novelists or poets: work by constant iteration on a design that evolves through the process of creating it.

**desc**: The development and writing of the "year by year" strategy game, 'Reigns', explored the potential of its core system, the swiping mechanic " la tinder". In this talk, 'Reigns' co-creator Francois Alliott explains how the team gave themselves a set of constraints defined by the gameplay they were exploring and the tone they wanted to give to the game. But these rules never dictated the writing of the game or the extent of what the game could be. Bifurcation and wandering were essential to write both the code and the content of 'Reigns' throughout the 6 months of its production. This sort of approach, although apparently messy and unstructured, is very powerful, especially for indies. Alliot believes that the industry is at the point where game development could almost be considered as accessible as writing, because the tools are less of an obstacle, and explains in this GDC talk how creators can use the same skills as novelists or poets: work by constant iteration on a design that evolves through the process of creating it.

People often underestimate stimulus demands for prolonged engagement and wind up trapped in expensive content treadmills. This talk covers patterns of human attention and engagement over time and concrete ways to design for those phases, including how to surface time components, approaching engagement with a relationship lens, transitioning from hand-crafted experiences to procedural and social systems, and balancing permanent progress with maintenance mechanics.

## The Evolution of Rodeo in 'Titanfall'

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024440/The-Evolution-of-Rodeo-in
**desc**: The 'Titanfall' series features wall-running pilots dueling massive titans on the battlefield. One of Titanfall's signature moments is something we call "rodeo",where pilots can sneak up on a titan and jump onto their back. In 'Titanfall', this culminates in the pilot ripping off an access panel and shooting the exposed circuitry to deal heavy damage. In 'Titanfall 2' however, rodeo becomes a cat-and-mouse game of the pilot stealing a titan battery, taking a chunk of the titan's health, and the titan frantically hunting down the pilot to get the battery back. Join Respawn Entertainment on a guided tour of the development of rodeo, as they reveal early prototypes, mediate on the lessons learned, discuss the difficulties involved in making sure that both titan and pilot understand exactly what is happening during rodeo, and detail what convinced them of the necessity to make large, sweeping changes to rodeo for 'Titanfall 2'.

While it's easy to dismiss Flash as a battery-draining browser plug-in on the verge of death, under the scrutiny is a bedrock of innovation and developers dedicated to craft. Flash paved the way for games to take risk, raising a generation of fearless developers and cultivating the emergence of the modern indie scene. This talk will attempt to encapsulate the immense history of Flash games and how it has shaped the current game industry. This is as much a story about how Flash lived, rather than how Flash has (maybe) finally died.

## The Freedom Fallacy: Understanding "Player Autonomy" in Game Design

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024043/The-Freedom-Fallacy-Understanding-Player
**desc**: Every year, players expect that they will have ever-increasing agency (or autonomy) in their gameplay. Today's mainstream players want their games to have hundreds or even thousands of hours of gameplay, and they want to be the ones who direct that experience. As such, it is extremely valuable for developers to have a nuanced understanding of player autonomy, enabling them to satisfy players while avoiding common traps that lead down bad design roads. Chief among these traps is misunderstanding autonomy to mean "giving players freedom," which often leads to player frustration and disappointment rather than satisfaction. This session will not only review such autonomy pitfalls, but will outline an accurate blueprint of what autonomy truly means, give examples of how leading contemporary designs optimize for autonomy, and discuss best practices and issues for the future.

The presentation layer uses Unity graphics and input, but is fully decoupled from the game simulation, which runs on a separate C# thread. Deterministic simulation keeps multiplayer synchronized, as game state changes only in response to low bandwidth command inputs that are shared across the network. Audiovisual presentation reacts to events and state changes output by the simulation. Vehicles are simulated in 2D using fixed point math and augmented with "aesthetic physics" in the 3D presentation layer. Large desert environments are authored as sculpted meshes painted with a multi-layered deferred decal system. Off-the-shelf and custom particle systems, shaders, post-effects and lighting are combined to achieve uniquely stylized visuals. Performance was optimized with a cache-friendly entity system, robust LOD techniques, and various extreme measures to avoid C# garbage collection.

## Zoom, Enhance, Synthesize! Magic Image Upscaling and Material Synthesis Using Deep Learning (Presented by NVIDIA)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1024339/Zoom-Enhance-Synthesize-Magic-Image
**desc**: Recently deep learning has revolutionized computer vision and other recognition problems. Everyday applications using such techniques are now commonplace with more advanced tasks being automated at a growing rate. During 2016, "image synthesis" techniques started to appear that used deep neural networks to apply style transfer algorithms for image restoration. The speakers review some of these techniques and demonstrate their application in image magnification to enable "super resolution" tools. The speakers also discuss recent discoveries by NVIDIA Research that uses AI, machine learning and deep learning based approaches to greatly improve the process of creating game-ready materials. Using these novel techniques, artists can use standard DSLR, or even cell phone cameras, to create full renderable materials in minutes. The session concludes by showing how developers can integrate these methods into their existing art pipelines.
