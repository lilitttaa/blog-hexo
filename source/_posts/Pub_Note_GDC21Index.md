In order to meet these demands, Assassin's Creed Odyssey moved away from a traditional scripted decision making system towards a GOAP-based planner. The team had an opportunity to apply the learnings from Odyssey to deliver the various creatures and denizen in Immortals Fenyx Rising. This session will provide insight on the challenges met and the lessons learned during the development of the planning system, across two projects.

## AI Summit: 'Death Stranding': An AI Postmortem

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027144/AI-Summit-Death-Stranding-An
**desc**: This session explores the unique AI challenges faced during the development of Kojima Productions' debut title, Death Stranding. Set in an Iceland-inspired, post-apocalyptic United States, a core focus of AI development was simply finding a way to support agents that could reliably and believably traverse the game's unapologetically unforgiving landscape. Learn about the strategies used to coax natural movement out of a brutal, fragmented navmesh, techniques to improve tactical positioning across extreme terrain, the hybrid pathfinding approach used to provide long-range navigation through the game's winding crevasses, terraces and ravines, support for traversal across dynamic, player-placed structures such as bridges and ladders, and more.

## AI Summit: Advanced Real-Time Hierarchical Task Networks: A New Approach

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027232/AI-Summit-Advanced-Real-Time
**desc**: HTN systems are an AI architecture for long-term behavior in games. However, the HTN systems have no mechanism to handle accidental changes or hostile agent behavior. When using the HTN systems in games where the situation changes in real time, conventional games have dealt with this by increasing the frequency of "replanning," which is the process of remaking the plan. In many cases, this resulted in destroying the long-term thinking of the AI. For this reason, we have developed ART-HTN, an evolution of the HTN system that is more suitable for real-time games. In this session, we will talk about how to deal with the problems of HTN systems and how to adapt it to various situations.

## AI Summit: Automated Game Testing Using a Numeric Domain Independent AI Planner

**desc**: Automated testing has become an invaluable tool for game studios, but most solutions are limited in what they test. At Rebellion we have redesigned our automated testing framework that goes further than most automated testing solutions. Instead of testing a part of a game, or have a bot play a level for an amount of time, we developed a system that plays entire games from start to finish like a player would. In this talk we do a deep dive into this framework and explore how it combines an Numeric Domain Independent AI Planning system with classical techniques, like behaviours trees. We will discuss how we managed the complexity of the system and the helpful impact it has had on game development. We will showcase this system playing a variety of games from different genres, including: 3rd person shooters (Zombie Army 4, Sniper Elite) and a lair-management game (Evil Genius 2).

While much can be accomplished using individuals, having multi-character interactions provides a richer experience. This talk will present in detail the aLiVE Group Behaviour System, a highly modular AI architecture developed at Ubisoft Toronto. This system allows for the creation of highly reactive group behaviours, used in Watch Dogs: Legion to author ID checks, extortions, crime events, hostage scenarios, protest groups, and police interactions. When the player interacts with these scenes, the group behaviour system can properly consider the group context and roles of participants to react in realistic and interesting ways.

In modern times, interaction between players and AI-directed characters often feels limited and lacking empathy. This work aims to apply a designer-friendly method to add an emotional pipeline to production, allowing virtual characters to interact with human users more flexibly and naturally than ever before. First, this talk explains the emotional pipeline (emotion, mood, personality and liking/disliking) and how this pipeline can be tweaked and improved to fit the needs of the experience. Secondly, it covers how to express the emotional state of the agent through not only animations, but also its decision-making, by covering each extension added to the AI pipeline. Then, it describes how to make this pipeline designer-friendly to give designers maximum control. Lastly, it will introduce two debug tools and guidelines to balance emotions and moods to fit the targeted experience.

Using examples and results from Madden and FIFA, where this technology has been applied, the session focuses on enhancements and solutions built to meet growing demands. The concept of passive interaction participation is covered, allowing characters and locators to interchangeably serve as reference points for interactions; enabling context-based single character animations, interactions with the environment, and even interactions with future intercept positions of moving objects. The session also delves into two approaches to integrating motion matching with multi-character interaction, without loss of player control; using single character motion matching to improve believability of transitions into multi-character animations as well as synchronized multi-character motion matching.

Scott will discuss some of the novel experience prototypes Facebook Reality Labs Research is building today that show the directions true audio presence is evolving towards, allowing us to create sounds that are indistinguishable from reality. Since games are (usually) made in the here and now, we'll then bring back what we've learned (from both a technical and aesthetic persepctive) from the future into practical advice and guidance for today. While these experiences were designed with a primary focus on virtual and augmented reality, the themes and best practices they expose are relevant across all of the interactive experiences we're building today, no matter what the media.

Some revel in the conflict and drama of social deduction games, for example, while others prefer the solitary planning of low-interaction Euros. These preferences come with powerful biases that shape board game design tendencies, often subconsciously. The truth is, there is no wrong way to enjoy games. Preferences and biases are unavoidable; however, designers who develop an appreciation of the diverse forms that game enjoyment can take are better able to create innovative and deeply satisfying play experiences.

These preferences come with powerful biases that shape board game design tendencies, often subconsciously. The truth is, there is no wrong way to enjoy games. Preferences and biases are unavoidable; however, designers who develop an appreciation of the diverse forms that game enjoyment can take are better able to create innovative and deeply satisfying play experiences. This talk from board game designer & podcaster Emma Larkins utilizes practical and philosophical categorization of play experiences to allow designers to find paths for uniquely delightful play.

## Board Game Design Summit: Making Sense of Digital Tools In Modern Board Games

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027441/Board-Game-Design-Summit-Making
**desc**: This session presents an overview of the use of technology in boardgames. First, it identifies the ways in which digital tools are used throughout play, from teaching and learning through to logging and tracking plays, and the diversity of tools both official and after-market that are used. Focusing on Hybrid Digital Boardgames, which combine physical pieces with smart digital technologies, it breaks down 41 different functions which digital tools perform. We classify these across eight core domains timing, randomising, housekeeping, informing, storytelling, remembering, calculating, and teaching. Published games are used to highlight how these functions contribute to gameplay. We will also report on how players and industry professionals feel about combining technology and boardgames. Issues include the definition of a boardgame; existing attitudes towards digital and hybrid technologies; the relationship between digital tools and game design; the costs of digital tools; and their impact on player experience.

## Breaking Design Bottlenecks with Dialogue Stubbing

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027410/Breaking-Design-Bottlenecks-with-Dialogue
**desc**: Authoring polished dialogue is a time-consuming process that may require weeks of work from writers. An efficient dialogue stubbing workflow can help the design team get content to a progressible state early, facilitate the eventual writing pass, and signal the size and complexity of a conversation. However, while a good dialogue stub can streamline design and writing, a weak stub can hamstring these processes. This talk will explain what a dialogue stub is, including the information that does (and does not) belong in it. It will cover best practices for stubbing as well as the pitfalls that arise from uninformative or overly detailed stubs. By the end, attendees will understand how to get the most from dialogue stubbing workflows on their own teams.

## Breaking Down International Borders: Confidently Managing Global Gaming Payments (Presented by Tipalti)

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027495/Breaking-Down-International-Borders-Confidently
**desc**: Best-in-class gaming companies set themselves apart by automating the entire process of paying your network of global gamers, developers, partners, and suppliers. Companies that address the full global payables lifecycle, from supplier onboarding, to tax compliance, through global payments, will not only expose themselves to less payables risk due to fraud or inaccurate payments, but also they will benefit from a major reduction in time spent on manual tasks and better supplier relationships. With payables automation, companies have more time to focus on strategic, business-growth objectives, and in-turn spend fewer hours managing manual payment tasks.

**desc**: This presentation will describe in detail the implementation of propagation netcode in 'Spelunky 2', an approach to real-time deterministic synchronization for scenarios where simulating 8 frames in 16 ms isn't feasible. 'Spelunky 2' is a simulation-intensive roguelike platformer with real-time, interactive, SPH-based fluids and big two-layer levels, as well as hundreds of traps, items and characters that interact with each other in emergent ways. Due to the complex, hardcore, and highly-interactive nature of the game's design, there were many tradeoffs to consider regarding clock-synchronization, network architecture, input delay, and type of netcode to use. The talk will also cover the various challenges of releasing and managing online multiplayer with servers and a tiny indie team.

## Community Management Summit: The Ever Increasing Impact of Voice Chat in Games

**desc**: The shift to online interaction during COVID-19 has placed a major spotlight on the gaming industry this past year - especially how games build and moderate their communities. And within community interaction, the greatest focus has been on voice chat, and the profound impact it can have on player enjoyment, empowerment, retention and loyalty, the emotional well-being of players, and most importantly, the bottom line. There is a wealth of research and data on this subject, much of which is likely unfamiliar to most game developers, publishers and their community managers. My talk will shine a light on the findings of this research, and will tie them together to help emphasize the impact that voice chat can have on players and the bottom line, as well as shift community management out of the category of being a pure cost center.

It needed a framework capable of depicting tens of thousands of distinctive characters, the ability for children to inherit the appearance of the parents, and immediately react to gameplay changes.Paradox chose to create a system based on DNA, which resulted in a novel approach to procedural character creation. All of which was done by a very small team, proving that is possible to create high-level art with limited resources.The talk will go in-depth on how the system works. It will cover some portrait system basics, useful considerations for anyone building a character system, the mistakes we made, and lessons learned along the way.

Accurate and detailed depiction of vehicles in previous Naughty Dog video games required significant texture allocation per asset and employed traditional baking methods. The vehicle creation pipeline was time consuming, requiring highly skilled artistry at each stage and due to level texture memory limitations, was limited in scale. This session will discuss a new approach that not only improved upon the quality and variation of the vehicle assets, but that was also faster to implement and could be scaled with far less impact on memory limitations.

**desc**: Introducing level design in a coherent manner to 3D beginners is a task that still waits on "canonical" teaching methods to form. Towards the formation of such a canon, this lecture will explore how to minimize confusion and maximize your students learning and creative output with conceptual lenses and a historical focus on the why, where, when, and what of tools and technical terminology. The findings here are the result of years of teaching and researching the best practices for introducing 3D modeling and applying it to level design immediately.

## Educators Summit: Living the Dream or Surviving the Nightmare: Making Commercial Indie Games as a Professor

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027436/Educators-Summit-Living-the-Dream
**desc**: If there is one thing that developing successful games and achieving tenure have in common, it is that they are incredibly challenging endeavors, often characterized by iterative failures. While taking on both at the same time might be a clear indication of poor life choices, the panelists of this session argue otherwise. Representing a wide range of institutional styles, academic backgrounds and game genres, these individuals managed to find a way to make their institutions support their games as research and successfully publish their work commercially.nnIn this session, the panelists address the opportunities and pitfalls of academic indie game development, through topics such as funding structures, dissemination and university validation, student collaborations, intellectual property, the development process and the integration of all of the above en route to promotion and tenure. By doing so, the panel provides a clear roadmap on how to fit your academic passion projects into a successful professorship.

**desc**: Programming and scripting are unpopular with art students around the world; even with technical art students. Technical artists need only be functionally competent, not necessarily excellent programmers. Students are more willing to learn a new skillset when they understand the relevant relationships to their interests. When presented with a short schedule and a handful of programming resistant art students, try a 6-week, python crash course using a commercial DCC as the IDE. This session describes how to create such a course and advises how to structure the homework for maximum effectiveness. The session provides the measured results for such a course and explains the reason for the numbers as well as suggestions how to improve performance in the future.

These techniques allow for creation of dynamic effects that simulate on the surface of static and moving geometry. In addition, the new methodology allows for translation of 3D world space positions into character UV space and back, opening the door for dynamically simulated effects on geometry, but written into render targets, or driven by underlying texture information.nWhile providing realistic simulation on complex geometry, these techniques utilize screen space information, making them affordable within strict performance requirements of games.nnExamples of this include: snow falling onto moving surfaces and sticking to them, dynamic water drips simulating on moving characters, dynamic blood simulation and custom behaviors for cloth vs skin surfaces, and others. The examples will be presented along with algorithms on how they were achieved.

Doing so on a platform, namely VR, which is constantly redefined and requires developers to explore interesting but intuitive forms of learning interaction is even more tough. Additionally, developers need to consider the requirements of two very different stakeholders - namely, learners and educators - while considering aspects such as fast onboarding, scalability in classrooms environments, security, and safety. This talk discusses lessons learned from developing the interactive VR learning platform "Maroon", which is currently introduced and evaluated in highschools. The talk will mainly analyze the challenges of designing, prototyping, and implementing an educational VR experience for learning STEM fields (such as physics) under significant budget and workflow constraints and discusses first experiences integrating such a platform in a classroom environment and iterating design workflows with young students in developing such an experience.

## Fair Play Summit: LIVE Fireside Chat: Getting Started with the Disruption and Harms in Gaming Framework

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027165/Fair-Play-Summit-LIVE-Fireside
**desc**: In late 2020, the Fair Play Alliance launched the Disruption and Harms in Gaming Framework, an unprecedented synthesis of what we know about problematic behaviour in online games today. Created for the industry and pulling together experts from game development as well as researchers from academia and civic society, the Framework seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of what we're seeing in games today, along with a series of resources (the first of hopefully many) pulling together some of the best practices known today for addressing these issues. This livestreamed fireside chat is a 101 intended for developers unfamiliar with the Framework and looking to get started. We'll cover an overview of the Framework, with a focus on the most important aspects to take away that you can start leveraging right away in your designs and beyond.

## Fair Play Summit: Tackling Cheating In Gaming

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027167/Fair-Play-Summit-Tackling-Cheating
**desc**: As gaming has rapidly grown over the last few years, cheating has become more widespread. If left unchecked this poses a serious threat to the long term future of gaming as it will put off new gamers, drive current players away, and drive up costs for game security. This session looks at how a new approach, based on data and a better understanding of gaming communities offers a practical solution that puts anti-cheat and community management teams on the front foot, protects the player experience and the brand reputation of the game, and supports financial security for developers and publishers.

**desc**: Today's games and virtual worlds give players ever-advancing ways to customize their characters, extending not only to their name and play style but also their personal appearance and voice. These customizations are powerful tools for increasing immersion and giving players a choice over what details of their physical self they're comfortable revealing, but they also entail potential risks of identity impersonation/theft, cultural toxicity, and diversity loss. A prestigious panel of game developers, technologists, academics and community thinkers will discuss the evolving technologies of self-transformation, and consider strategies for maximizing their positive impact on virtual communities.

**desc**: To keep players hooked for years, free-to-play games need a constant flow of liveops, events, offers and new content.nOften, this ends up making a mess out of the game economy: it breaks the flow of resources, makes some rewards superfluous and makes the early game noncoherent for the player that's just starting. This ultimately means that the game becomes harder to maintain and monetize, and less fun.nnThis session will tech you how to become game economy doctors in free-to-play mobile games, focusing on three specific points in time:nBefore the launch -- How to design an ingame economy so that it doesn't break later?nWhen the game is live -- How to keep it healthy?nWhat if everything fails -- How to fix a broken economy?

## Free to Play Summit: Ludo-Narrative Goldilocks

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027260/Free-to-Play-Summit-Ludo
**desc**: "Ludo-Narrative Dissonance" is a well-worn trope among game design geeks. The term, coined by Clint Hocking, refers to how actions a player takes during gameplay (Ludo) often don't line up with the story (Narrative) the game is trying to tell. nnThere has and always will be a chasm between the tools and mechanics used to challenge players and achieve fun and those narrative techniques necessary to setup environments and characters to craft a quality story. Most AAA games solve this by masterfully advancing plot and character during cut-scenes that occur between bouts of twitchy gameplay involving an avatar that happens to look just like the story's protagonist.nnIn free-to-play games, trying to roll out meaningful and connected story elements often becomes even more dissonant. In F2P, the gameplay structures, the system math, and the gating of content is designed around the player's immediate compulsion and continual long-term retention, often with unpredictable cadence and length of sessions -- some as short as one minute.nnIn good storytelling, world-building and character-building are done at a deliberate, careful rate where the writer carefully doles out bits and pieces to advance a plot and keep the audience engaged and surprised. It's why storytelling is usually done in a linear fashion on proven timetables such as the 30-minute sitcom or 90-minute three-act screenplay.nnIn free to play, the usual method to monetize is to charge players to speed systems up... So time itself is always exaggerated, either hyper-slowed or hyper-sped-up. Many free to play games also offer non-linear choice to try to keep players engaged, gating and surfacing clear short, medium- and long-term goals and allowing different types of players to arrange their gameplay around their level of general mastery and how much free time they have each day to check in and play. nnTrying to have the game goals advance both the math model and a cohesive narrative model is pretty much impossible to do well. nnAnd yet, some people have pulled it off.nnLooking at examples of hits and misses, we'll try to play Goldilocks and articulate the "just right" amount of narrative to make free to play successful.nnOn the plus side:nnGardenscapes and its Ilk: How a sprinkle of narrative revitalized the Match-Three category. nIdle Games: How games like Trailer Park Boys Greasy Money figured out how to gate narrative via small bite-size "episodes", using it to structure levels, drive events, and actually increase monetization beyond the point when a player may have gotten bored by the mathy mechanics alone.nObvious wins like Episodes and Choices which really are hella light on interactivity and mainly pure narrative with light branching.nnAnd on the negative side:nnTelltale's experimentation with free to play on mobile and why it utterly failed. nHyper-casual titles trying to deepen themselves with meaningful story and pretend they are anything beyond a cynical exercise in rewarded-ad arbitrage and existential compulsion.

## Game Narrative Summit: Press Y to Cry: Generating Emotions in Videogame Narrative

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027221/Game-Narrative-Summit-Press-Y
**desc**: Everyone working in videogames knows the answer to 'can videogames make you cry?' is 'yes!'. (Seriously, where you've been the last 20 years?). The real questions are - 'Why make people cry?''How do we make players love, laugh, despise, sympathise, or empathise instead...?' and 'How do developers ensure players feel the right emotions?' Getting players to connect with a game's setting, narrative, or characters provides more than artistic reward, it can add millions to a game's income. But, while videogames have a track record of making players feel scared, thrilled, or titillated, the industry's emotional palette is still small. This practical session looks at existing models of 'Press Y to cry', 'X to shag', or 'O to ponder the existential nature of the universe', and explores a range of other models and solutions for how to deepen emotion during gameplay. Come and share the love (hate, jealousy, trust, joy, etc).

**desc**: Balthazar Auxietre, Creative director at InnerspaceVR will give an introduction to how VR native tools can change how we approach level design in games and share how he built the intricate and various worlds of his latest VR production "Maskmaker".nSwitching within seconds from small model to giant building, these new tools allow an acute sense of space, giving the ability to iterate rapidly, intuitively and above all, collaboratively. Balthazar will discuss openly about learning the strengths and weaknesses of this process through the stages of the development of Maskmaker in comparison to previous experiences and how he thinks these tools can empower level designers' workflow both creatively and technically, especially when working remotely. But beyond the buzz, can these tools become the go-to way suites of the future for any professional looking forward to making VR, or for any designer working on any virtual spaces ?

## Games as Community Driven Care: A Case Study of Co-design for Aphasia

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027179/Games-as-Community-Driven-Care
**desc**: In this talk, we explore the potential for games as a community-driven, cost-effective, and radically-accessible form of care. We detail this through the lens of a case study in designing therapeutic games for and with people with aphasia, the 2+ million Americans who experience language loss due to brain injury. Game-based rehabilitation is a promising solution to address unmet long-term recovery and psychosocial needs for people with aphasia. In this talk we describe a participatory game design process that engages people with aphasia, speech language pathologists and professional game designers in the creation of three hybrid digital-analog games. We detail methods for facilitating collaboration across language barriers and divergent professional expertise. We also contribute a set of design principles based in rehabilitation research and augmented through our iterative design process. We conclude with recommendations for pursuing community-empowered game design for other underserved populations and explore how game design can be a powerful context to facilitate meaningful change in health and well-being both online and in the real-world.

**desc**: In this installment of the GDC Main Stage and follow up to GDC 2019's 'The Developer's Journey', 'The Developer's Impact' is a multi-part presentation delivered by three esteemed game creators: Osama Dorias, lead game designer at Warner Brothers Games Montreal, Ziba Scott, the "Optimist" at Popcannibal, and Lyndsay Pearson, executive producer and GM for The Sims at Maxis, a studio of Electronic Arts.Part 1: 'Heart, the Secret Ingredient to Great Games' (Osama Dorias)This presentation will draw from the experiences of Osama Dorias, Lead Game Designer at WB Games Montreal, as he discusses how his struggles with xenophobia growing up as a Muslim Arab in the west inspired the narratives of the games he has worked on. Osama will also share the stories and experiences of other notable video game professionals, both AAA and Indie, who have similarly sourced their own lives and personal stories when crafting their games.Part 2: Kind Words: Why Be Nice? (Ziba Scott)Being nice isn't the sexiest game mechanic -- nothing explodes and there's no reason to wear cool body armor. So how did Popcannibal convince players to send each other four million uplifting messages? Ziba Scott will share the leap of faith in humanity that birthed Kind Words, and the limits required because humans are messy.Part 3: 'Valuing Inclusive Game Design' (Lyndsay Pearson)Video gamers of today are more diverse than ever before. To begin tapping into the future of the market, it's becoming increasingly important to design games that appeal to a broad audience of players from all backgrounds and cultures. In this talk Lyndsay Pearson will cover how inclusiveness impacts our games, why it's important to grow inclusive culture in our workplaces, and how The Sims has evolved the franchise to reflect this trend.

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027183/Google-Maps-Not-Greyboxes-Digital
**desc**: During the creation of Untitled Goose Game, Jake developed a level design practice informed by his filmmaking background. Rather than sculpting levels with greyboxes and working an environmental context onto them, he went location scouting (with the help of Street View) for real world places that fulfilled the game's design needs. Using this method, the level design of the goose game is a collage of real-world spaces - an interplay of requirements set by chosen source locations, level affordances, and aesthetic restrictions. Come and hear about this process and its benefits, and find out which village in England the goose game is based on.

Self-Determination Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) is a macro theory of human motivation that emerged from research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and identifies three universal psychological needs that, if satisfied, enable optimal function and growth: competence, autonomy and relatedness. In this talk, Alexandre Moufarek discusses how SDT can help build intrinsically motivated teams that sustainably show a high-level of performance and find great satisfaction in their work. "Happy game developers make happy gamers" is not just a saying. It's science.

This session will introduce what is and how to build such a 3D parametric face model, and give implementation details to three techniques built upon this model, i.e., creating face meshes from images, producing shape and expression variations from one example face mesh, and facial performance capture.

## Machine Learning Summit: Creating Cooperative Character Behaviors Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027385/Machine-Learning-Summit-Creating-Cooperative
**desc**: Creating cooperative character behaviors is very challenging and is costly to studios of all sizes. Deep reinforcement learning can be a great approach because a developer can articulate the desired objectives or goals and have the machines learn the best behavior. This can impact the economics of the development of the game. However, most DRL algorithms are intended to solve single character tasks (hence no cooperation between characters). However, there are new advancements in cooperative DRL tools, such as centralized critic, that can be leveraged to create cooperative character behaviors in a game. In this presentation, we will go over these topics and illustrate a real-life example of a studio using deep reinforcement learning to create cooperative characters in their game.

## Machine Learning Summit: Creating Game AI by Using Mostly English, with Semantic ML

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027396/Machine-Learning-Summit-Creating-Game
**desc**: One of the most difficult problems in crafting a believable character AI is accounting for every conceivable interaction the player may have with your character, and the tedious process of creating the glue between the player action and the content you've created for your game. But what if you could use Semantic ML to skip that glue step entirely? In this session, some demos using Semantic ML will be presented, showing how it can be used to quickly prototype and craft an AI and its personality using just a simple spreadsheet. Best of all, a natural language interface that doesn't require intervention from a programmer can allow the developer to solve problems at a higher level of abstraction, using the English language instead of simulation variables, and empower the less technical members of the team to contribute creatively to the crafting of AI behavior.

**desc**: Navigation is at the heart of every AI behaviors in games. However, existing navigation solutions such as Navigation Meshes do not scale well when characters can use complex (yet common in games) navigation abilities, such as being able to jump several times, using a jetpack, teleporting, wall jumping, using jump pads ... In this talk, Maxim Peter and Joshua Romoff will dig into the details of a novel alternative explored at Ubisoft La Forge, proposing to use Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) to teach bots interacting directly with a game pad to navigate on complex maps using navigation abilities. They will explain how this solution works, discuss the advantages and limits of their current solution and provide examples of successfull integrations in Ubisoft games.

## Machine Learning Summit: Full-Body Animation Generation for Expressive NPCs

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027392/Machine-Learning-Summit-Full-Body
**desc**: Animations are extremely important to augment the believability and effectiveness of non-player characters (NPCs) for game users. Our session describes a novel approach, relying on deep learning technologies, to automatically synthesize high-quality and life-like full-body animations for talking NPCs. The animations involve lip and chin, upper facial expression (eyebrows, upper and bottom eyelids, and eyeballs), head rotation, torso and hand gestures, and legs and feet. The synthesized animations can reflect speech prosody, express the emotional state expressed by speech and correspond to specific personalities and professions of NPCs. Without any manual intervention, it takes only less than 500ms to compute full-body animation trajectories for an utterance which lasts about 5 to 20 seconds. The automatic animation generator allows animators or artists to be released from manually creating animations and processing motion capture data.

## Math In Game Development Summit: Conservative Mesh Decimation for Collision Detection and Occlusion Culling

**url**: https://gdcvault.com/play/1027336/Math-In-Game-Development-Summit
**desc**: Collision detection and occlusion culling can be sped up considerably by reducing the complexity of the used triangle meshes. A popular method for decimating a mesh is the Garland-Heckbert algorithm. This approach uses edge contractions to reduce the number of triangles. The maximum error of the decimated mesh is bounded by a so-called quadric error metric (QEM). In this talk, properties of QEMs are discussed. We show what causes issues when using QEMs to find positions for newly created vertices and how to improve mesh quality. We show how to choose the new vertex positions conservatively, i.e. such that the decimated mesh either completely encapsulates the original mesh for the purpose of collision detection, or is completely encapsulated by the original mesh for the purpose of occlusion culling. Performance tweaks and termination criteria are addressed, and trade-offs are discussed.

This is unfortunate, because there are many well-studied solutions.

Such approach overhauls existing drawbacks in single modeling paradigm by yielding adaptive and comprehensive player analytics. Multi-model analysis systematically identifies the most suitable models to employ for each game genre and its lifecycle stage. The models then analyze player behavior throughout their journey from D1 to synthetically reveal the reasoning behind their churn and purchase. Understanding these individual retention and consumption behavior is integral to leveraging further engagement with hyper-personalizing gaming experience for each player. This session dives deeper into the evidence of multi-model's advantage and how it is substantively implemented to encourage more purchase and longer play time.

While these grey markets entice players with the opportunity to find a highly-desired item, or a new-release game at a discount, they're rife with fraud and, even in the best of circumstances, rob developers and creators of revenue for their hard work. nnThe solution however, is not to limit players further but to leverage blockchain technology to build inclusive player-owned economies, legitimizing grey markets and opening new doors of revenue for players and developers alike. The future of game entertainment will depend on closer ties between players, content creators, brands and developers, and blockchain delivers the power to transform these relationships and invite everyone to become true stakeholders in game economies and virtual worlds.

**desc**: This session describes new executable/core dump debugging tools developed at Naughty Dog and most recently used during production of The Last of Us Part II. These tools are built on top of Microsoft Visual Studio debugger and allow for a scriptable interface to process memory and debugging. Game engines are extremely complicated executables with many threads/jobs running in parallel, racing data accesses, passing pointers around, iterating through many collections of complex data, etc. Each crash or erroneous condition is a digital forensic mystery for the programmer. nnThis talk will describe the development and use of the debugging tools that make it easier for programmers to solve some of these mysteries. The tools allow us to script game specific conditions, analyze variables, parse memory, etc. with interactive and iterative python scripting. Case studies will be shown on where and how these tools were used to track down complex errors and memory stomps in crash dumps.

## Stop Getting Lost: Make Cognitive Maps, Not Levels

**desc**: Unless a game is explicitly about navigation, getting lost in it will almost always result in an awkward and frustrating experience. This age-old problem plagued architects and urban planners long before it plagued designers in the game industry. Luckily, level designers and environment artists have the opportunity to learn valuable lessons from these more experienced disciplines. This talk will leverage cognitive science, anthropological, and urbanism research to explore what it means to get lost and how spaces can be designed to prevent this from happening. By identifying elements in the built environment that contribute to more comprehensive cognitive maps, developers can start creating virtual environments that are more navigable, memorable, and less likely to disorient players.

## Technical Artist Summit: Better Computer Graphics through Understanding of Human Visual System

**desc**: Computer graphics used by computer games continues to make significant advances. From modest beginnings in the 80s and 90s we have reached the point where we simulate and display complex light-matter, optical, motion and physics interactions. As hardware and techniques used become more sophisticated, we must also pay more attention to how generated visuals are to be perceived and interpreted by human visual system. It is important for several reasons: Human visual system, while effective, is not technically accurate and may lead to misperceptions of hues, light intensities, sizes and shapes as well as general attentional misperceptions. Understanding human visual system better may help alleviating these issues but also to help developing more computationally efficient algorithms that maximize what is important for human vision and minimize what is less likely to be perceived. The talk will overview the modern understanding of human visual system, such as hue, intensity, shape and motion perception and discuss specific implication on camera design, anti-aliasing, lighting and global illumination techniques.

**desc**: Wukong AI, an artificial intelligence program, playing Honor of Kings, a popular MOBA game published by Tencent, exceeds the performance of top-professional player. Based on the superhuman AI ability, Wukong AI has been applied to many aspects of game, such as Wukong AI challenge, game balance testing, etc. However, to achieve these goals, there are many challenges need to be tackled, such as cooperation between multi-agent, human-like behavior and strategy diversity. Wukong AI adopts a combination of novel and existing learning techniques, including off-policy adaption, multi-head value estimation, curriculum self-play, policy distillation, and Monte-Carlo tree-search, in training and playing a large pool of heroes, meanwhile addressing the scalability issue skillfully. Although WukongAI use Honor of Kings as a case study, these proposed techniques are also applicable to other MOBA games, as the playing mechanics across MOBA games are similar.

**desc**: Properly triaging a game is an art. Doing it right could take a game from being a mediocre player experience to being a great player experience. I will discuss how triage changes through the product development lifecycle. How time, money, and resources play into triage. The dangers of outside pressures placed on the project too early like determining the final budget, resources, and timeline before the core gameplay loops are fully baked. I will provide examples of effective techniques and tools I have used over the years to help better triage a game. The two main areas of focus in my presentation will discuss the journey to come up with a minimum viable product for launch and how to maintain the right level of quality control throughout the production lifecycle. Providing examples of how to strike the right balance of quality features/content at launch that will keep the player engaged while the team is fixing launch issues and getting ready for the next content release.

During this presentation, you will see how the artists use in-game editors to build multi-use, optimized special effects directly for the environment and content teams without software engineers needing to be involved. You will also see the various tools that were put in place as safeguards against giving the artists direct access to the underlying modular programmable pipeline; Tools that keep an eye on auto-generated script correctness, resource utilization, and provide the artists with feedback for troubleshooting problematic technical issues. This session doesn't deeply delve into simulation or rendering specifics. Rather, this session covers the different tools, techniques, and tricks the studio has found to work well while giving their artists more direct control over special effects than in the studio's prior games.

Each acts like a mini reboot for our brain, which allows us to go back to work relatively refreshed. Now, most of us sit in one spot and stare at the screen all day. But we often find ourselves more easily exhausted and less productive. In situations like this, every bit of brain power counts. And we as tool developers want to be aware of the state our users might be in, and be mindful about how much brain power we are asking for in our tools.

## What Can Game Designers Learn from Competitive Reality Shows

**desc**: On August 23rd, 2000, more than 50 million Americans watched the finale of the first season of Survivor, making it a cultural icon and birthing the age of competitive reality shows. More than twenty years late, reality shows do not reach the rating high they did in 2000, but they still have a surprising amount of staying power. While there is very little work around the game design of competitive reality shows, we can learn a lot from the strategic gameplay, emergent narrative and complex play experience they provide. As the game industry is pivoting toward creating games that allow players more agency and freedom, game developers struggle to create compelling experiences without complete control over how they will be played. Reality shows, games with simple rules and complex emergent mechanics might be one answer for designing those experiences. Those games are repayable, still relevant, and provide a different experience every time they are played.
